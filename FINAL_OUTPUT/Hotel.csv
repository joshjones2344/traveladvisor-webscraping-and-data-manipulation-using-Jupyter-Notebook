She had a pleasant stay & said the place was clean & tidy. She was picked up by the shuttle from the airport on time. All meals were part of the package which was excellent. Quality of meals was good. Thanks guys for what you do in these crazy times. All the best.\\MaasGolf\\We spent  just one night in one of their junior suites. Huge room with a little kitchen. Wonderful small quiet pool with in water seating directly at the pool bar. Very friendly helpful staff. Outlet mall and many restaurants within a few minutes walking distance. Fantastic breakfast and a free shuttle van to the airport early in the morning. Can definitely recommend if passing through Mactan/Cebu City.\\Lucy P\\We stayed here for 1 night to catch our flight early morning.  It was such good value for money and we had a free upgrade on checking in which was a lovely surprise after a long day!  The room had loads of space and was really clean.  We went to the outlet shopping next door that had Nike, Adidas etc   The restaurant had really nice food, we both had sandwiches and a bucket of beer for good value - big shout out for Argie who was so lovely.   The airport shuttle was included in the stay which you need to book when you check in, it was so easy and quick!\\Jude Palces\\I had a wonderful 2 days at Eloisa's. The property is 15-20 minutes from the airport.There is an outlet nearby for shopping and dining. Everything started right with a free shuttle from the airport. Check-in was seamless and easy. What really set this property apart from other hotels, in my opinion, was the friendly and caring staff. I had a Junior Suite and it was huge. The sheets smelled fresh. Bathroom was clean and had all the amenities one expects from a hotel. Free breakfast was excellent with a lot of choices. The live band in Daku Bistro really added a nice touch to total experience. I did not try the pool but it is aesthetically designed and looks really pretty at night. I will definitely return to this place the next time I am in town.\\Aillen L\\At first glance, we thought that it’s just a simple hotel, but when we checked-in.. it was totally beyond expectation. + Room- stylish and spacious with excellent Wi-Fi. Bathroom is small but it’s fine. Breakfast-i love the buffet and the staff were nice. Place- I’m soo in love with the place and it’s like you’re in a resort. Pool- Nah! Soo beautiful and with stylish curtains. It’s even more nice at night. Good for kiddos. - Location- It’s away from the downtown, but it’s not fine since there are malls with fantastic restaurants and boutiques beside the hotel.\\42Veggies\\Would be a five star review had they not put us in room 203, facing the main road. The honking all night did not help our jetlagged bodies to fall asleep.  Also the second night the people in room 204 arrived at 4 am heavily intoxicated, they were screaming in the hall ways and after half an hour took their noise into their room, the one next to ours, and continued loudly screaming and laughing until I got out of bed, got dressed, went into the hallway and yelled at them to shut up. Really we were right above the reception and the staff should have adressed this situation within minutes.  But back to the rave review because the hotel really is very good. The beds are very comfortable, the room is immaculately clean and very nice and well equiped, the staff go out of their way to\\Meggy\\We stayed at Eloisa Royal Suite for a night since it was near the airport and we have an early flight the next day. We arranged our transfer-in with them and they were very flexible. Our flight was delayed (we arrived at 10 pm) and when we called, they said they have a flight tracker so we need not worry. Check-in was a breeze and we were upgraded to an executive room. Our room is nice, it has access to the pool🙂. I guess whether the room has a window or not will depend on the type of room you booked. They have a takeaway breakfast for those who have an early flight. You may choose between bacon with rice or tuna sandwich. My only comment is that wifi is a bit slow in our room. Overall we had a wonderful night and will stay here again if we go back to Mactan Cebu.\\LJ V\\The hotel looks nice but the room is smaller than I thought. The staffs are really helpful. Food is good could be better. They have free shuttle so it's good to consider it airport hotel it's not that far but always leave early Cebu always have chaos traffic.\\94klj\\Great hotel in a great location. Ideal for people looking to stay near the airport, although not much in the surrounding area. The room was very clean and a decent size. The reception staff were extremely helpful when we were checking in and at all other times. We had two early morning trips and had breakfast prepared for us on departure. Was great for a two night stay over between destinations.\\RaynerAO\\My 2nd stay here and I wasn’t disappointed at all. My stay at Eloisa was very pleasant. Location wise, it was great for me. Food area probably 5 mins walk away? Outlet shops too for those who want to shop. Close to airport too.  The staff were really helpful and approachable. My room (located in the same building as the lobby) was clean, comfortable (toilet too) and everything functioned well.  For those who want to keep fit, their gym, though small, was clean and well equipped with proper machines and weights.  The best experience though was when I was done with work for the day (late afternoon), had already checked out in the morning but was sticky and sweaty. I wanted to book a room for a couple of hours just to freshen up but was instead lead by the staff to their guest\\Littlelizamay\\The staff are friendly and helpful. The room was clean with a fridge, kettle, and tv. as well as hairdryer. It is near the airport and the hotel has its own transport which is very useful. It would have been great if there was some form of ""welcome pack"" in the room detailing the services available in the hotel as well as a list of attractions nearby.\\Max W\\My girlfriend and I booked this hotel quite late during the day due to our flight rescheduling. We decided to choose this hotel due to the close proximity to the Mactan Airport on the map. We did request pick-up from the airport in our online booking, however as it was late during the day, the hotel may not have seen it.  When we landed at almost midnight, not to our surprise, we were unable to find any hotel personnel for the pick-up service. We called the hotel and they said that the driver was already at the airport, however they were not able to tell us where exactly the driver was waiting. It was made more confusing as the airport has a number of exits. We called the hotel a number of times and explained our exact location where we would be waiting, and after an hour or so\\Zhaun O\\When checking in, please ask for a room on the new wing where rooms are smaller but are more thought-out and have a view of the pool and are away from the road (read: less traffic noise)  Here is the lowdown:  1. Free airport transfer 2. Buffet breakfast 3. Luscious sheets, down (duck feather) pillows. They gave me dour pillows on my Queen-sized bed 4. Awesome customer service! Everyone greets you with a smile 5. Walk from the lobby to room is about 50-meters but they insist to drive u via gold cart 6. I asked how much their bottled water is (was thirsty), they insisted on giving it to me for free on top of the 2 bottles that was already in my room 7. You can get a poolside room for as low as 3500 8. They'll be offering speedboat island tours soon! 9. It's near Plantation Bay\\Danny\\This hotel was incredible. Seemed like it was newly renovated and they were looking for a super modern look. It was good. I could tell that they were kind of limited on space, but they still did great with the space they had. I actually received a message through Orbitz, from the staff, asking when I would arrive and if I needed pickup from airport/wherever. That was very nice. Check in was smooth and painless. The room was very nice, bed very soft, bathroom was very nice, but the room was a bit small. Which was fine because that's the room I selected, but it was still very nice. Checked in, showered, then walked about 5 minutes to this strip mall/restaurant area nearby, where there are many many food/shop options. Right next door to the hotel is a massage place, reasonable\\Ian C\\During my second stay here, the staff never failed to give me a very relaxing stay. Their tireless but genuine greetings, quality service and more vibrant hotel will make you decide to stay here again and again.  The wedding that i would be attending is pretty far from here but knowing how Eloisa crews take care of their guests, I don't mind traveling farther coz I can't sacrifice that relaxing stay I wanna achieve this time.   Thank you ERS! Keep up the good work! 😊\\Divina A\\Just the best of the best, our second stay in this hotel, rooms are clean, big, comfy beds and modern, they have free shuttle from the airport, breakfast is amazing, everybody that works at the hotel are just super nice. Thank you again for the great stay, we will see you guys soon.  Salamat\\Beth I\\We flew into Cebu airport late and they provided a very nice van shuttle for free. The rooms are nice and clean. Very modern. The bed was so comfortable I forgot we were in Asia! The staff are helpful and friendly. We recommend this place to anyone. Only negative thing was the traffic noise starting about 6am but it wasn't terrible, you could just hear it. We will stay here again!\\Littledeans\\Best hotel in Lapu-Lapu city, they provide free airport transfer. Massage center just right next door of the hotel and easy access. Area surrounded by the Nike factory outlet there are Puma, Giodano, Levis, Adidas, timbeland and so on. There are Robinson market store for your convenience, and also 7 eleven, Love this hotel will all the friendly staff especially the bell boy,security and receptionist. They provide hairdryer the most important things that i would like to put a comment. Due to the hot weather and caused that taking shower few times a day hair dryer are seriously needed by me (May be for other tourist as well)\\jneth5\\Love this place! I booked Eloisa so we have a place to stay during our long lay overs in Mactan, Cebu (from and to USA). I love that they have a free airport shuttle service. It gave me so much peace of mind that we are being taken care of especially that we were transiting in the odd hours of the night. Many thanks to Oscar Luna of the concierge. I commend him for his hard work and care for my family. He is very polite and extended valuable tips and information. Thank you, Oscar!   Eloisa also offer a shuttle service with minimal fee if you desire to go places or arranged for pick up.   A massage parlor is located next door, which comes handy to work the kinks out of your body after the long flights.   Food is no problem. They have a restaurant on the first floor.   The hotel\\Len D\\Accommodating  and friendly  staff, neat and clean room. We stayed 2 days in a suite room and 2 days in a deep Luxe room. The weekend dinner buffet  was absolutely  great. I love their pasta and pancit that the chef will cook live according  to your liking.\\BDCE\\This is a great hotel for budget conscious travelers or business travelers who just need a place to sleep after a hectic day.  This is a relatively new hotel. Value for money hotel.  LOCATION:  About 10 to 15 minutes from the Airport. Walking distance to Robinson's grocery, factory outlets of such brands as Adidas, Oakley, Giordano, Converse, etc, and dining establishments.  A ride away from the Island mall.  Along the main road and accessible to public transportation. Free airport transfers.  ROOM: We booked the room with 3 single beds.  Room was big but with no windows. furnishing is quite modern.  Room and bathroom were clean.  Bathroom has a shower with hot water.  FOOD:  The only restaurant in the hotel is quite small but serves good food.  Grilled tuna belly is highly\\ziggy2l\\When we checked in from Mactan Airport, we made the mistake of not using the free shuttle service from the hotel. The cab fare was not that bad anyways, just hard for some taxi driver to find the place because it is new. The hotel itself is nice and new, for the promo price; it's worth it. Staff was helpful specially the security guards. There was this one waiter that was hard to communicate with but it was a minor thing. The bathroom sometimes smelled funky and our room was hard to find, it was like a maze. But let me emphasize that all of these were minor.\\Vinay-OnTheGo\\Stayed for a Day in the hotel with my chinese friends. Very nice and friendly hotel staff. Clean Hotel, Nice service, 15 minutes drive from the Cebu Airport. Had to check-out early morning at 5 but the hotel arranged a free shuttle although it was raining and packed our breakfast too.  Very nice and comfortable stay!\\jodyk505\\Stayed one night on Tuesday, September 16th before catching a flight from Cebu to Puerto Princesa the next day.  Was greeted by the receptionist and she handled check in tasks superbly explaining everything comprehensively.  The rooms were spotless and the hotel was very quiet.  The breakfast buffet is awesome and if you feel like pampering yourself, head over to the spa and massage parlor right next door.  Very close to Mactan Cebu and Robinson Supermarket and factory store outlet.\\ALLAN S\\Stayed 2 nights for business in the area. *10 mins drive from the airport. *Short walk to Outlet Store, Robinsons Supermart, 7-11, Mcdonalds, restos. *hotel looks and feels new. *airport shuttle available. *buffet breakfast...good selection. *wifi, cable tv, a/c. *beds and pillows are memory foam...slept very well. *toilet and bath...very good.\\djali9\\This is a great place to stay. The staff are friendly and the service is excellent. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Not every room has a window, so keep that in mind when booking. We booked as a large adult family group, and emailed prior to arrival; the staff were excellent, sorting out our complicated booking and accommodating all our requests. My baggage was delayed at the airport, but the staff were very helpful and called to sort out delivery of my suitcase for me. The hotel is in a good location for looking around both the cities of Lapu Lapu and Cebu.  I would definitely stay here again!\\JenTravelMeHappy\\This hotel was one of the best we had so far on the Philippines. The room was really nice, the shower was great, the bed comfortable, the WIFI worked in our room, the staff was very friendly and especially the onion soup from the inhouse restaurant was very delicious. Also the shuttle to the airport was free.\\Kit Yeung\\I spend almost three night in Eloisa because of there staff and teams is really the best, they all friendly and hard work, whatever u ask they will do it and try to be very helpful, they are the great team to serve the customer well. i have been travelling many countries and city and i bn visited different hotel but i find Eloisa is just like your home in cebu, u just missed them even i leave cebu and i return back again to check in Eloisa when i need hotel in cebu, i am also a budget traveller but i find it worth to pay more for they service because the bed is the most comfortable in cenu, and clean, the room is not to big as photo, this is one of the issue i talk to them, but except that the breakfast is a bit not western so i request for a western toast and sausage breakfast\\Sweetcath\\Well,no more I can say to this hotel. From the driver, guard to all the staff of this hotel. I and my husband are very proud and happy while we stay to this hotel. We felt like we are home becausw of the staff. Very energetic, always smile😁☺😀😊. Not like the other hotel we stay to mention(the bellavista hotel).,I really don't like the staff there. And by the way we had our free breakfast for 3 nights and the foods are very delicious,and also we try to eat their foods for lunch which is `TUNA BAGAYBAY,STEAMED TUNA STICK and GINGER SOUP "" All their foods are very delicious. Also the place is near the Outlets for shoes products.You can walk for 2-3 mins. And easy to get taxi wherever you go.because its near in terminal. I hopw to stay again in this hotel for next vacation. I and\\Eonlight\\Clean and modern room with free wifi, free shuttle and buffet breakfast, in fact they made us a special omelet that morning which we really appreciate of their kindness. All staffs are great and very hospitable.   The restaurant, lift and check in/out counter is all in one compact space. In fairness management did their best in maximising the space for the functions, a credit to them. Also it would be good if windows are double glaze for noise reduction from traffic all night.  A much decent place to stay in Mactan and Cebu in comparison to other accommodations around and a good base if you like to go to the beach around Mactan Island. Highly recommended to travellers. Value for money.\\Kim C\\This hotel Lacks a pool and a beach, however, that is fine because you can travel to another resort to use theirs.  The thai massage business located next door provides excellent services and very affordable prices.  The food and the service at this hotel was quick and sufficient. My breakfast was included and it was good. The prices for buffet dinner was affordable and good at p399/person. The room I booked was a deluxe and was so tiny for two people. However, it was very clean and new and I only needed it for two nights.  The location is in a busier area next to the outlet stores and other stores, walking distance. Short ride to the malls and to the city. It's a bit sketchy at night of outside the hotel.\\Desidel\\This is a very nice place to stay, I stayed here July 2015. Perfect location for shops, airport and trips to Lapu Lapu Cebu City also. Very friendly staff, couldn't do enough to help you, the rooms were very good to, nice and clean. Food here was good, Wi Fi ok, airport transfer included . I will definitely stay here again, everything here was good, I couldn't find any faults. This is a good place to stay. Thanks to all the friendly staff.\\Graeme M\\Very comfortable hotel , Biggest bed ever with the most pillows,comfort plus, Large room with microwave , Grill oven , full size under bench fridge , Always given clean towel and  a room clean every day.   The breakfast was sumptuous with a nice range , The best of all was the lovely helpful pleasant staff making our stay the best ever . Thank you all so much.\\erezmazor\\if you're en-route this place is really close to the Cebu airport. Clean and nice and the staff is really sweet. The rooms have no window but the AC is working great so it's not stuffy. All in all this is a great spot to spend a night or two.\\Samuel D\\I had a fantastic stay in Eloisa. The rooms were very comfortable, clean and great value for money. The staff were all very accommodating and attentive to my every need. The hotel pick-up and drop off were a bonus with friendly and careful drivers. The breakfast was sumptuous and wifi was great. i will surely come back again soon.\\appmountaingirl\\About 10-15 minutes from the airport, Eloisa is a great pick for early-morning flights.  The hotel is still quite new, and the rooms (though very small) were comfortable and pristine.  After 2 weeks in 4 other hotels in Asia, this was the most comfortable bed out of all of them!  Staff were exceptionally helpful, offering to pack us a breakfast (at no charge) for our 3:45 AM departure.  Shuttle to the airport was scheduled at a time that suited us, not stuck to an on-the-hour schedule.   About 25 minutes from Cebu City shopping, about 15 minutes from Lapu-Lapu beach areas, and about 15 minutes from the airport.    Highly recommended!\\DonPedros\\Having been appointed a night at the Eloisa by the airline due to a cancelled flight, the choice to stay here was not one in which I was involved by other means than accepting the offer by the airline. Being located very close to Mactan Intl. Airport in Cebu, it's great for people with airport activities. The rooms are small, but they are modern, clean and well equipped. Our room on the top floor had issues such as non-functioning sockets, leaking showers, non-functional phones, sporadically non-functional elevator and other minor issues, however I should empathise they were minor issues. The food from the cafe in the hotel was decent, however it was with great disappointment that I found that their Tuna was not real Tune, but ""White Tuna"", or rather the variant which actually\\Eddie AMS\\Learned about this hotel via Tripadvisor and booked it based on good reviews.  Service is really good in this hotel. All staff are friendly and very helpful. The room rate is reasonable and location is good if you prefer to stay in Mactan Island and closer to the airport. There is a factory outlet with some dining options within easy walking distance.   I booked a superior room. The room is nice and clean. The only downside was that there is no window and wifi coverage is very very minimal to zero. But, for the price that you pay, it compensated the aforesaid and we could always go to the lobby for better internet coverage.   To add, this hotel provides free airport transfers. You just need to inform them your flight details once you've made your bookings, regardless of booking"

Can't wait to be back there for my last night in Cebu tomorrow! Here is why: -the check-in was smooth and fast.  -ideally situated right next to Ayala Center -staff at the concierge is very knowledgeable and knows how to help people and give good advices. -the room is BIG! And overall good cleanliness. It was not ""spotless"" because the hotel is not new. Some things look used but absolutely not dirty. We asked for more toilet paper and the houseman who came saw that we had no bottles of water (actually we put them in the fridge haha) so he brought us two extra more without us asking anything. Good hotelier sense! -the breakfast was A-MA-ZING. Lots of choices to please every client (asian + western dishes) -we also used the\\bob1cat\\We stayed two nights at the Mandarin Plaza hotel which is about 300M walk to the Ayala mall if you need to go shopping.  The hotel does not have a shuttle to the airport or harbor for ferry service but taxi's are available for 250 - 500 pesos.  The breakfast buffet was better than we expected with both hot and cold items to choose from. Refills were no problem.  A few items on the buffet change daily.  If we needed to visit the Ayala mall we would stay there again.\\Olivia d\\This hotel is fabulous, not only is it centrally located but the hotel has everything you want..reasonably priced, spotless rooms, great showers and good wifi. The hotel has a pool, sauna and restaurant. We ate here two nights and the food was delicious and cheap too. The staff were what made the stay however, they were so helpful and friendly, from the concierge to the wait staff. So thank-you!\\Teresa B\\The room was spacious, clean and the food at breakfast was alright. Though at the time of checking in there was one lady on duty, it took a little bit of time to get my turn in the queue, but at least she gave me the room on the 17th floor. It was quiet and good view of the city lights.\\livi88\\Good standard hotel. Room Was clean and comfortable. Food is average but very reasonable. Very friendly staff. Ideal location for Cebu city - directly across from the mall. Not a whole heap to do in Cebu city itself but good location to do day trips from.\\Cameron B\\On my first impression of the room was wow...it was a great size, very spacious. Staff were always friendly and helpful, especially when i asked for a TV remote control, as the rooms only come with a cable TV remote and i wanted to play media from my personal hard drive. Buffet breakfast was good, plenty of choices, both western and Asian cuisine available...the only negative i found was the bacon...not everyone likes crispy bacon. Location is great, a short walk to Ayala Mall and the must try House of Lechon (it was so good i went back 2 nights in a row) Pool was good, gym was a little hard to find (not that i used it) Overall i enjoyed my stay at the Mandarin Plaza Hotel and when i visit Cebu again, i wont hesitate booking here again.\\CheriedPretty\\My mother and I stayed in this hotel overnight and boy, I was surprised how the hotel's interior design and magnificent color mesmerized me. the entrance lobby looked so grand with crystal chandelier hanging over an oversized centerpiece. The room (superior room) was equipped with ref, hair dryer, slippers, laundry bags, and complimentary drinks. Although there was nothing on the bar, still i appreciate the cleanliness and orderliness of the entire room. The room service was prompt and the restaurant was open until 11:30PM! The food selection was not many but sufficently delicious and varied...there are cereals and congee for the kids too. the breads are fresh. This hotel definitely deserve my second visit!\\Arra Ezekiel N\\Pro - Near shopping center / Ayala IT Park (3-5 mins walk) - Near the pier (20mins by car) - Food is great - Accommodating and very kind staff - Clean and spacious room and toilet. - taxis are lined up outside - fast internet connection  Cons - Same breakfast menu everyday (buffet) - When I stayed there last April 1 2018, the bedsheets had stains and the bath towel was frayed and torn - 45mins travel from the airport\\Dorothy W\\Really enjoyed my stay here. Warm friendly welcome. The hotel is close to Ayala mall which has a large selection of shops, bars and restaurants. Room very clean and communal areas. Staff helpful and professional.\\Richard H\\First, let me speak of the hotel. This was my second stay, and it would have been my third, had they not been booked up on my last minute trip a month before. I love this place and the staff, not to mention the close proximity to the large mall. I’ve done a lot of traveling in the U.S. and across Asia. Often, even nice places have flaws and aging, especially in the bathrooms. This place is always spotless and in excellent condition. On this stay, I needed a toothbrush, and seeing an employee in the hall, mentioned it. She wasn’t a housekeeper and didn’t have anything with her, but when I returned to my room, two toothbrushes and extra T/P awaited me. Now, for the rave. I was extremely stressed on this trip and did something totally out of character: I left my passport and PHP\\Steve J\\I travel...A LOT!  This was my first stay at the Mandarin, and I will be back! It is conveniently located to Ayala Mall and many other Cebuano musts...like great cuisine and professional massage parlors, such as Nuai Thai, just a stones throw from the Mandarin, but well worth the short walk.    I arrived late at night from the USA, so a speedy, helpful, and friendly check-in process was a must. Justine and Christian made this possible! My room was clean, comfortable, and the aircon was good...but not great. The bed was amazing, and the WiFi way more than adequate! The rooms are also very spacious, which is helpful since most international travelers arrive with a lot of luggage.    The breakfast buffet, which is included with your room, was very good, and the pancit canton I had\\loida gac-ang\\I enjoyed while staying at this beautiful place.They have yummy and unlimitted food.Good ambiance at the dining place. Accomodating staff and crew. The place were very nice and so accessible because it is located near the mall.\\JinDee8\\We enjoyed our stay at the Mandarin Plaza. Our room was very spacious, and we really appreciated the complimentary bottled water, and coffee bar. The hotel was nice and clean, and staff was friendly and accommodating. Our only gripe is the limited selection for the breakfast buffet, but we are grateful that they even offer it for free, so can't really complain. We recommend this hotel, especially if you want to be close to Ayala Center.\\Marlaine Hope R\\Aside from booking a room for an affordable price, the place was huge and just enough for my active two year old son to run around to his heart content. Cozy and spacious. Breakfast was a buffet of sumptuous food. A feast for my eyes and stomach early in the morning.\\Aggeliki K\\Beautiful hotel with nice rooms and pleasant environment, tight in the central of the city. I tried the cocktails at night with relaxing live piano music. The rooms are quite big and nice, and friendly staff.\\Patricia P\\Loved staying at this hotel.  Breakfast buffet was fantastic with different food options available.  Room service facilities excellent, such as house slippers and bag for groceries.  Tea and coffee with fresh water provided every day.\\Nicx\\This hotel is value for money. It's hard to find a hotel in the heart of Cebu City with a bath tub for two thousand pesos. The hotel is clean, big, with free breakfast, tasty in-room dining service, walking distance to a mall, with pool, bar, restaurant and friendly staff. Will come back if I am in Cebu again.\\Seaside750551\\They are very strict with the check in and out times, but they have great rooms and facilities and delicious buffet. The location is convenient to Ayala Malls but a bit crowded. I would recommend this.\\The Aimless traveller\\If you’re a solo or business traveler needing peace and quiet, keep in mind that it’s full of group tourists and families, and in a crowded part of Cebu. Otherwise it’s an excellent comfortable hotel with all amenities, good breakfast and polite staff.\\Judfae M\\I checked in on July 7 and out on the 9th with a friend. I was surprised by the spacious room with basic amenities. You can have the other needs upon request.   I thought the rate would be much higher..but it was affordable.  It was easy for us to go to and from Ayala, Cebu as it was just across the street.    Hotel staff and maintenance were friendly and professional.  Buffet breakfast was really nothing extraordinary..but just fine for what you pay. I would still look forward to staying in the same hotel in the future."

There is a cycle for their breakfasts. Ours was on a Monday so it was: Continental Filipino American.  Funny thing.. corned beef is in the American breakfast.  Oh sorry. No Canadian breakfasts. Haha.  The rooms were fine. The ""air con"" was strong and so was the hot water in the shower. No problem. OMG! There were a few ants. Hahaha. So what. It's the Philippines. They're everywhere.  The staff was courteous and friendly. I wouldn't hesitate to go back.  The door latch in room 505 needs to be reversed. It comes right off when you open the door.\\Tracey W\\we were there and the sea room villas that we were kindly moved to were lovely, we had everything we needed and they were very clean, just what we needed at the time. The food was good and reasonably priced and I can still say that after eating from the same menu for 3 weeks solid :) The pool bar and cocktails were fab and I am sure that had we visited at a different time we would have really enjoyed a few nights there. The staff here outshone some of the staff that we encountered in some 5* resorts, they went above and beyond at a time that was also difficult for them, thank you from the bottom of our hearts and We wish you all every success in the future xx\\jax70Manchester\\As we could not leave the resort this was very considerate, although it has to be said the food was not overpriced beforehand. With regards to the resort it was clean and tidy.   On our last week due to only 12 guests the management made the decision to move everyone to one block: an upgrade given free of charge. In the end there were only 8 guests left in the hotel.  We took the repatriation flight on the 7th April and the Manager Reynold arranged for the hotel bus to take us to the airport, free of charge.  The staff got up extra early (430am) to provide breakfast prior to our departure. Overall I cannot praise this resort enough.  All the staff were wonderful but a big shout out to Rey, Apple and Jay.\\Beth\\requested FO to change the linens as they doesn't look fresh. Additional amenities that you might add in the balcony which is really necessary after swimming is a drying rack. The drainage in the bath tub as well doesn't drain so easily. And you can check as well the doorknob since while we were there we had these connecting room and our room's doorknob doesn't lock; it didn't matter that much as the main door knob near the living room is locked. It's room 709. Nevertheless, I want these improvements to help you in making a better Pacific Cebu Resort, hence, I may come back since I had a nice stay! Thank you!\\serenegypsy\\number of certified diving instructors.  They have 2 restaurants, 4 pools and cabanas spread across the property. There's a very long pier that goes out to the sea. I think it's half kilometer with 4-5 hut stops if you want to rest.  The end of the pier is a snorkeling spot and a take off point for small boats. There is a small beach area fronting one of the pools. Everything is a sea of white against the sea and lush greeneries. This is a resort that you will be happy just taking in the view of the sea or the surroundings or just even your room.  At night the main pool, the pier and the walkways are strategically lighted up and club music is played across the grounds making the place look magical."

Leslie was very pleasant, apologetic and corrected my mistake. Kudos to her! The hotel was also very clean and convenient. All other staff were also very good and responsive and respectful.\\Godxxx01\\You literally see the hotel the moment you get out of the airport terminal.  Cross the not so busy road with your luggage in tow. No hassle reaching the reception in a 3 min zipp walk.  This is a old style Grandish hotel of the 70’s and need some updating here and there. I love the swimming pool area but hates the service there, normally takes at least half an hour for anything you order. As the resto is few floors up and there is no pool bar. I guess the hotel management focuses all their energies to the real money making part of this business??… the casino attached to the hotel.  All can be better and has the potential to be a real TOP HOTEL of Cebu with a bit of TLC. One thing I happy about is they have also accorded the right price for the services they now offer without\\Irwin (INCOGNIT... S\\My wife and I have stayed at Waterfront Airport Hotel and Casino 5 times and can think of no better Hotel to stay at when we travel to Cebu. The entire staff is awesome, and they go out of their way to make you feel at home, When were last their in March, they were not able to do Buffets, which they have restarted. From our previous stays with the Buffets, we can assure you they are a great value for the cost of each of them. Furthermore, the food is fantastic. We look forward to staying there again in the future. Keep up the good work.  I  North Carolina, USA\\Bianca G\\From the moment we walked in the entrance if Waterfront Airport Hotel& Casino. we were thoroughly impressed. The interior decor was outdated yet warm and inviting and the personnel we encountered were all very pleasant and accommodating. The room was crisp and comfortable and wow, what a pleasant view at their poolside! We were surprised by it!  The food was ok, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the staff and How accommodating their are in our needs  Overall, what a wonderful stay and a Great Price.Special thanks to you for making all the arrangements for us. We thoroughly enjoyed it and appreciate all the work the hotel put into our visit. We would definitely recommend the Waterfront Airport Hotel as a great place to come to relax before\\rodellelay\\Minor fine tuning for Bell Boy, Security at the Main door and Resto closes at 8PM. Suggest if Lift is Not working, better close it or put a signage that it's not available.   Superb Rooms, Clean and very friendly front desk.\\MihoTakeuchi\\Employees were very nice (Front Desk, Security, Housekeeping) and helpful, hotel followed health protocols. I had a great sleep and a great time. Thank you as well to Mr Ali Banting for the warm hospitality. I will be back for sure! :)\\Erick_Mark\\Good environment and very relaxing spot to go in cebu. It gives an authentic kind of structure. A positive and fun people around the hotel. Truly one of the best in the country and in cebu city. My stay in the hotel will always be one of my best times their in cebu. It makes every moment memorable with family and friends. Especially when the place is really good.\\heyycarolinelim\\If you want a hassle-free near airport accomodation, then this is the place!   Number one my list is their fluffy pillows and comfy sheets! Real fluffy. Try it to believe it! 😉 Second, is their new normal crate. I also loved how they provided it for the customer's peace of mind. Third, food!\\roxanneandoy\\Location is great, very close to the airport and they are providing free shuttle to airport. Their food is not that much costly and with generous serving. I asked to print a 2-page document and they charged me 58 pesos each page, quite expensive, some hotels offer printing services for free. But overall, it was great, staff are very accommodating and they allowed us for late check out.\\stanedwards\\Had a great time. We had a very clean room. Front desk staff were exceptional.  Great customer service. Restaurant food was excellent. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Beautiful hotel on the inside.\\Markus\\This hotel is our go-to transit hotel. Cebu is in! It’s super close to the airport, facilities are well maintained. They even upgraded us to a villa overlooking the pool. Doreen at the front desk took her time to assist us with our reservation and was cheerful and wonderful!\\suegirard2019\\The shower didn't work so I wasn't able to use it.   Service was excellent. I liked having a gym but I think it should have opened earlier than 7 am.  I am vegetarian and was not able to find enough food at lunch or dinner to make it worth the cost of the buffet.\\Anne!\\Our flight out of Cebu got cancelled due to a typhoon, and since I was sick of slumming it in hostels we decided to stay a night here. What an excellent decision. We booked through Booking.com, and our room was upgraded on check-in to something that was larger than my apartment at home! Minibar beers were reasonably priced (unlike the Sofitel Plaza in Manila). Staff were all very friendly and food was good. Comfortable bed with all the amenities. The only fault is its location, it is only really convenient for the airport and if you are using a driver for all of your activities. There is not much within walking distance to explore, and apart from eateries there is not much on Mactan island in respect to bars.\\RDesilets\\Stayed here 2 nights before departing Cebu.  Excellent accommodations.  Very comfortable and quiet.  Tons of amenities!  In room safe, stocked refer, excellent wifi.  Dinner buffet is out of this world.  Lots of different cuisine to choose from.  Will definately stay there again.\\daniellw2017\\I was supposed to meet my wife there but the typhoon kept her stranded in Mindanao... It was and always has been my favorite place to stay ,because the service,hotel quality,and location to the airport...\\MyronMelliza\\Most of the front desk personel are friendly but not all. One in particular i talked to when i got in.  When i asked the security for a taxi he wasnt in the mood i guess. He just got me one without one word to me.\\debcafe411\\Huge rooms, very clean rooms and premises, super friendly staff, wide selection at buffet breakfast, superb airport transfer service, hardworking concierge and security crews, and adorable canine security staff.\\Jovie143\\This is a place to be when your staying in Cebu. The place is nice and clean, beds are so comfortable to sleep. we didn't have any issue at all. They even have a restaurant next to the Lobby. Food is AMAZING!! Can't wait to go back again!\\R3710IEjamesd\\I make monthly trips to the Waterfront Hotel and Casino, am never disappointed. Year after year I am able to depend on a great stay. Always relaxing.

The buffet meals are delicious and the staffs are courteous and friendly. One peeve is, they always have one roll or halfway roll of toilet paper that’s thin, so ask for extra. Besides that everything is good.\\zobellemsb\\Our experience was awesome. My kids enjoyed and love the Family room we had. A great Family place to stay. Will definitely be back again in our next Family vacation and will definitely recommend it to our Family and Friends here in Australia.\\Journey65609513004\\If you want to travel with ease, convenience and practicality in mind, choose this hotel.

Also breakfast buffet is unbelievable and free.\\Footprints641230\\This is a very nice hotel.  I love the location across the street from the airport.  This makes it easy to get some sleep when I get in on a late flight and gives my fiancee a place to stay when I fly out on a late flight.\\Robert86364\\Overall the hotel is very nice and clean, breakfast is good but a little expensive Bad thing is that we were charged for 1 Coke from the mini bar in our room but we did not drink any and this has happened before\\masaponkichi\\Controlling the room temperature was very difficult for us. It's too cold for us. So we always prepare our own pajama.  But thank you very much for upgrading our room.We really appreciated your kind treatment.\\melvinmerlu\\Only 1 roll of toilet paper supplied in the room. Personnel were pleasant. Variety of food selections and were excellent. Customer servicing was exceptional. Location was great. Security is topnotch. I stayed one night only and so far everything was alright except we cannot find extra roll or rolls of toilet paper.\\M6529SDkennethh\\As usual our stay @ the Waterfront @ Muctan airport was great!

So close to airport and the place and staff are amazing. I arrive and greeted like one of the family. Would highly recommend this hotel.\\imfegarcia\\My mom had an amazing experience staying at your hotel. She said employees were friendly and accommodating. Thank you for taking care of her through your free shuttle service from the domestic airport to your hotel and from the hotel to Cebu Mactan International Airport. Her travel went easier.\\evarias2019\\during our stay at room 103 for 2 nights, there was an ongoing repair in room 101 and we smell the paint that makes our sleep very uncomfortable. the ref was not working so i had to call for service to replace the unit. it should have been checked before we checked in. it was my 3rd time to WFMac but it was the first time i had a sleep discomfort.\\cwmccabe98\\We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Waterfront. The place was nice, clean, & fun. The staff went out of their way to make sure that we were comfortable from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. I would DEFINITELY rate this place as a5 star!!!\\TaintSaint\\Stay was great. Only 5 minutes from the airport. We stayed there for the beginning and end of our trip. Really convenient for redeye flights. Buffet was amazing (especially the Tocino, a must try.)   We were upgraded to a deluxe room free of charge on our first night. The hot water wasn’t working, but they quickly fixed it, thanks.\\dalcoriza\\Based on 3 day staying at your hotel, overall rating is Excellent. Excellent in terms services, amenities and location of hotel.   Recommendation: Please provide an Flat iron on each room in order to iron our clothes.\\madamedelmas\\We stayed many times in this hotel for the past 2 yrs. I love how the staff manage the checking in and even upgraded us to a bigger room for the same price. Feeling the comfort away from home. Highly recomended hotel.\\John R W\\I made the reservation at the last minute and was surprised that the rate was so reasonable.  I was also given an upgrade to the executive floor that has a very nice view of the airport. The hotel is also very quite.  The only negative is that there is no gift store.  Very much appreaciated.\\Anthony C\\After a long flight this is the place for me. Room  was clean and cozy, staff very friendly and  accommodating, food just perfect for  me. Will stay again when in Cebu. Close and convenient to the airport was a plus for me."

I have stayed in various Red Planet locations and most of the time they have exceeded my expectations. Same for this stay because the location, amenities, cleanliness, and value for money were all excellent.  I would also like to commend the staff because they were extremely helpful and went beyond expectations, especially Charish at the front desk! She helped us find a nice transport service from Cebu City to Moalboal after almost being scammed by a GrabCar driver.  I will definitely stay in Red Planet Cebu when I am back in the city!\\Julian Q\\Stayed here for 3nights and it’s well maintained. Very clean and simple not bad for a 2 star hotel.

The water pressure was excellent and the bed was extremely comfortable. Internet works perfectly.\\Brijraj S\\Professional business budget hotel. No frills are provided. Their methods are new but practical and if very low price but good value is what you need....  choose Red Planet. Located opposite Ayala mall so lots to do in the free time.\\kcsant0s\\I will recommend Red Planet Hotel-Cebu to my friends who are going to Cebu. It was a good overnight experience in the hotel. Was able to go quickly to Ayala mall. I wish breakfast was served within the hotel :)\\Marc Ian O\\I stayed here 2 nights. And it was a memorable experience. The place is near to Ayala Mall and few minutes from the Airport. There is a convenience store just a few steps away for an easy snacks and needs. Staff are very friendly and professional. They will attend to you promptly with courtesy. There is also a covered parking space. I will definitely visit again this place.\\Girley B\\The first Red Planet Hotel I stayed was RP Aseana and since then, wherever I go, I always choose this hotel.

The only thing I don't like is this review requires a minimum of 2020 characters..\\artogle\\Good location, clean rooms, clean linens, reasonable price, excellent staff! Near my office, and the mall.   Everything inside the room is white, white linens, white bathroom, depicting cleanliness.  Reasonably priced.  All the staff are approachable, accomodating, helpful.\\cesargalleno\\when you enter to your room you will amaze since its very clean and  have a comfortable beds to sleep, then  the amenities are also good. The location is easy to locate and its near in a department store.\\John\\Paid ~PHP6,100 for 3nights in mid-July 2018.   Just the bare essentials in the room but clean.  Central enough location to Cebu City and Mandaue City although a bit far from Lapu-Lapu City.  Easy enough to get a GrabCar.  If you have your own car, they have free on-site parking with security guard - ask him to help direct traffic if you're having difficulty merging - don't forget to tip!\\MayMay1222\\The place was so nice and the service was excellent. Truly a good place to stay especially it was located in the heart of the city. And also, what I like most is the security. You will never worry about being harmed because of their unique security that I never experienced in other hotels."

Recently refurbished so most of items are fully equipped and in working condition. Front desk staff, Geneva, provided a personalized touch, good job! Located in busy main road, just ignore the sound of constant traffic. Had a pretty good sleep. Good location as it's near to airport & slightly further from the city. Saves the time stuck in peak period traffic.\\dhor o\\Awesome service and friendly employees, always willing to help. Pick up & drop off to the airport is always on time. Food is delicious, and the rooms are always clean. Highly recommended  to stay here if you decide  to travel  to Cebu.\\Leslie C\\We only stayed two nights on our return from Bantayan, on our way to Boracay. The close proximity to the airport made bit a good selection. They had a small restaurant downstairs which was ideal, in that we didn’t have to go out to eat. The food was quite good. We found the breakfast to be lacking a bit, as there wasn’t a big selection to choose from. The room was small, but comfortable. We had a problem with the hot water to the shower. They tried to fix, unsuccessfully. There were no power points on the bench to change the phone. They provided a shuttle service to the airport. Overall it was ok. Would probably stay there again.\\Agot76\\This is indeed a really good hotel especially when you are in quarantine. Although we didn't get to explore the place since you know, we are in quarantine but I can say the services and the staffs were all attentive to our needs. Their service is exceptional to say the least. From the pick up at the airport to finding a car/van to use for travel to the next island everybody were very helpful. I was so impressed by their services that I told my niece who is visiting Cebu too to book from this hotel for her quarantine. Keep it up guys!\\Cielo P\\Mom and I needed a room for the night near the airport since our flight the next day is very early. It's a clean quaint hotel with a resto. I found it expensive considering the size of the hotel and rooms with no windows but mom was quite satisfied. That's all that matters. Your pillows may need changing.\\Cat\\We had a very comfortable stay at Goldberry, the room was very spacious for two people and would recommend to book the suite room with the balcony especially when quarantining for a few days so that you have private access to outdoor space. The staff were very friendly and super helpful. The food provided from the Rabbit Hole was above average, we had a mixture of the quarantine menu and a la carte which was good. The wifi was very reliable and fast, I was able to do work online, watch shows on Netflix smoothly and connect well with relatives/friends abroad easily. The facilities in the room were very good and it was very clean. I definitely recommend a stay at Goldberry.\\rezeille\\A guide for the Quarantined.   This hotel is outstanding!  - very friendly and accommodating staff - very clean and comfortable room  - free airport shuttle, less than 10mins drive from the airport  - adheres to COVID protocols  I highly recommend this place! Yes it’s not Dusit Thani but for the price and their positive points, I say, “book it!” I’ve been to many hotels all over the world, their staff and cleanliness definitely beats most of them!   Despite being under the strain of the pandemic, the staff are genuinely friendly and very efficient too with my requests.  Their compassion for the quarantined-tired-to the bone-travelers is evident in their interactions with me—they even called me twice because I forgot to call them for my meals (jet lagged). Now, that’s quality\\Aeeo73\\We have stayed at this Goldberry location before, prior to Covid. And now is our first choice that they are accredited. It’s not the cheapest choice. But, the choice we know of, as the staff here has always been friendly and they offer free airport transport. Best of all their deluxe rooms have balconies of various sizes. They also offer standard rooms and suites for different budgets. The Goldberry is more in-line with a western styled hotel, as opposed to the Asian brand smaller sized rooms. The rooms are mostly spacious but very in size and are mostly clean. Although Mactan’s location is showing wear. They provide direct booking with full board or on-line booking with only free breakfast. Meals for lunch and dinner at an additional cost with full room service available.  So I\\Diomedes E\\I would not have survived a long 10-day hotel quarantine without good staff service by Goldberry Mactan! I asked for a room with windows, and I was given a spacious room with sliding doors and a balcony.  The bed was big and comfortable. There was a community below me, and by keeping the doors open the whole day, I did not feel alienated because I felt like I was part of the community's daily activity. Thanks to Geneva and Maimai of front desk! Thanks also to the resto staff for accommodating my meal requests, it can be difficult making a choice for 3 meals ordered for 10 days while being locked in a room for quarantine. The meal servers were prompt too. My request for a late checkout was easily granted too. I believe I survived because Goldberry is competent as a quarantine\\Erine\\Highly recomended this hotel. Very amazing staff & the place so neat & clean .Rooms are very cozy & warm😊. The food so yummy & tasty.Special  thanks to Jasmin front desk for being so helpful for booking our room.\\TravelerFromTokyo\\You pay about $50 for this hotel.  In the US you would pay at least $100+ for a similar level airport hotel.  $200+ in big cities.  Hotel is clean, beds are comfortable, rooms big, airport transfer is easy & quick.  Breakfast sucks but you can’t have everything.  Overall, great.\\DivingTropical\\This Hotel is a good choice. Close to airport with free airport transfer. Lots of food options around. Hotel is nice and comfortable with all you would need for a day or two stay. The breakfast is a little weak compared to western standards but it's ok. We filled out and honest comment card and maybe the will improve slightly. Just small first world issues. They were out of beans 45 mins before closing, when we asked for more they put one spoonful in there I assume so they wouldnt possibly have to waste anything. The lady working at the breakfast had exceptional service. Everyone in the hotel went above and beyond to please you. Good Job!\\Shirrrbyyy\\This hotel is located right close to Cebu International Airport. Perfect to stay if you have a flight to catch the next day. I stayed in one of the suite rooms. Bed was comfy and the balcony was pretty spacious. You get a view of the local Mactan life. The bummer was the shower though, as there was no additional shower head and the water was lukewarm. Other than that, the location is convenient as you can walk to local eateries, and to one of the bigger malls as well. But do remember to take a taxi back when it gets dark (especially for a solo female traveler). The breakfast was decent as well. Actually, definitely better than what I had in Bohol!! And the free shuttle service to the airport was excellent!\\FrankieDP\\We were travelling from the UK with a night stop in Mactan.  I made my booking through Booking.com and contacted the hotel to avail the shuttle service using the email address provided by Booking.com  The hotel confirmed within 12 hours and the shuttle service was excellent.  We asked for a quiet room and they upgraded free of charge to the back of the property.  The room was spacious, the king size bed very comfortable and there was plenty of choice in the mini bar.  The rooms and corridors are a little dark but the whole place was spotlessly clean.  I particularly enjoyed the on site massage facility and the small café/ restaurant serving simple food.  The breakfast choice and quality was good and staff very helpful.  I asked for two fried eggs, over easy, and they were\\SunsetStMartin\\An overall fantastic place to stay in that's near the airport!  The bed was very comfortable, there was hot water, the wifi worked well even inside the rooms, there's also a water boiler available in the room, and the breakfast buffet was so good! The fish, and the corn beef was so delicious!   The food in the restaurant, the Rabbit Hole underneath the hotel was also very good! I specially really loved the kimchi fried rice. Excellent value and very delicious!  The hotel also offered a free-drop off shuttle service from the hotel to the airport.   The staff was also very helpful, and pleasant.  Cons: Perhaps the cons for this place is that it's more expensive compared to the other hotels in this road/area, but it's well worth it, and it gets your money worth.   Will overall\\zenny T\\This place is near the airport and its a nice hotel with a huge room and big balcony and food are great room service is fast and wifi is okay as well..room is clean and staff makes you feel you are well entertain\\Paul G\\We were in the deluxe room which is very large, has balcony seating and was very quiet. The furniture and bedding was very comfortable and we had a great time relaxing cocooned from the rest of the world.   Overall the room was very clean with just a little bit more detail on the glass shower screens and mirrors required.   The staff were very friendly and helpful and I would be happy to come back just for that level of service.\\rosaspandan\\Room was huge with balcony and seating areas. Shower/sundries were great. Staff were friendly and very close to the airport.  They provided airport transport even very late at night and early a.m.  Free breakfast at an attached restaurant was OK.\\Travel_Lover0316\\Hotel is close to Mactan airport and provides free shuttle. Staff are friendly and accommodating. This hotel is close to marina mall and island center mall. Accessible to the new and old bridge. They have a restaurant that offers variety of food for bfast.\\VinceofOrmoc\\I love the place. Very clean and impressive. Quite expensive but you'll have buffet breakfast.  Internet is slow but manageable. It's also 10 minutes away from the airport, definitely a perfect place to stay if you need to be near the airport. But again, this is not an ordinary hotel so it's quite expensive.\\violetvodka\\very near the airport. used an airport taxi and meter ran only to 120.  the next day from the hotel to airport, it was barely 80 using a regular taxi.  comfy bed, quiet place to sleep.  room came with breakfast, but it wasnt so great.  very ordinary breakfast buffet.  i think only the cornflakes tasted okay.\\Glenn P\\Fantastic hotel, and service. Rooms are big and beautiful. The hotel staff is friendly, professional and helpful. Highly recommended. The bed are big, soft and they have thick blanked. Aircon and TV. Internet is slow. The room have dark and mood wood interior.\\SEdgSantos\\Me, My partner & Two of my siblings enjoyed our stay at Goldberry Suites during the Sinulog Season. They have a very helpful reservation team who assisted me adjust my booking at such a short notice (as one of my sibling only decided come to with us to Cebu at the last minute). I did agreed to pay for an extra person & roll away bed. As it was a peak season I know most of the hotel are fully booked. Yet Reservation/Front office management manage to give us an upgrade to a Suite to accommodate all four of us which is very much appreciated by myself and everyone.\\mjmboogie\\I was upgraded to the best room they had at no charge. The room was very spacious & clean. There was some noise from the traffic at street level. The hotel is located on a main busy road, but it gets quite as the city winds down. The price did include a free shuttle to the airport, they have their own van. A free breakfast was also included. The close proximity to the airport makes this a good choice if making an early flight is a concern. Traffic to the airport is a non issue when you are this close. I would also recommend this for business travelers doing business on Mactan. Booked thru TripAdvisor, maybe that is why I got up graded. But I never asked.\\Clarisse M\\Booked a one night stay at the hotel. A good place to stay if you do not want to be tangled in the traffic of Cebu City especially if you are catching a flight. The hotel offers free airport pick-up/ drop-off.  Its location is perfect for hailing cabs and jeepneys but the hotel is not close to the Cebu city tourist attractions.   Staff are accommodating.\\SunnyJung0526\\I choose this hotel due to close location from Mactan Airport. I got hotel pick-up service from airport although it's 3am. I booked Deluxe room it was very spacious and cleaned. Amenities are enough and air conditioner was well-functioned. Free breakfast was included and all tastes good!:-) After check-out, I asked to drop-off at nearest supermarket and hotel staff kindly did drop-off service. It was my first night in Cebu and staying this hotel makes me fresh start in Cebu. I will definitely use this hotel again when I visit Cebu again. :-)\\Zephyr1103\\My nth time to stay in Goldberry Suites & Hotel, still having those warm treatment from their  personnel, Keep it up guys....Nino, Lady, Lilian and May May even Geneva?? the OJT....to and from the Airport....thanks to their drivers...Marco??, Ric , Melvin....There's always a room for improvement though, breakfast?? yahh must focus there guys....not bad, but an improvement will be very much appreciated.>>>>>Romeo of ""B""\\Cindyrella C\\They have a shuttle service, good breakfast, midnight check-ins. All in its price. Rooms are clean and decent and staff are kind and friendly. I had a lovely experience. I was surprised of the late check-ins but it suits well for transit passengers.\\Hermione G\\I had a good experience here  not to mention the friendly stuff , complimentary , perfect ambiance of rooms  , good food , exquisite wine , I will surely vouch your hotel to my friends. ❤️ - last minute holiday\\Mona081967\\Everything was great, the room and the location.  We loved the place and  we will definitely go back! The graveyard shift staff were nice too.  The night shift who checked us in was not though. NOT welcoming or anything. Seemed we were just distracting him. Otherwise, I would really recommend this place."

We were very happy.  We organised a transfer via the hotel from the airport which was excellent, I highly recommend.The resort is well kept and very attractive. The ground staff were seen working really hard everyday. The grounds are immaculate with plenty of places to sit, rest, sunbathe and just soak up the atmosphere. The gift shop is useful and has friendly staff. The reception are helpful and informative. Our rooms were beautiful, I had the biggest bed I’ve ever seen. We had a stunning view too.Rooms are super roomy and have everything you need. Complimentary water and tea/ coffee too was very welcome. They are also quiet. The housekeeping staff do an excellent job.  The food was very good,\\Elvin A\\PROS: - Nice location - on the Mactan Island beach front. - Room was big and clean. Had 2 queen-sized beds and a lot of space to boot. Room was well appointed too. - Bathroom had a tub and was also very big! - TV and aircon were modern already. - Wide selection of food in their resto and fairly-priced too.  CONS: - Lighting needs to be updated. Yellow light makes the room look so dark and haunted. - Window shutters by the hallway are starting to separate already. You'd need to manually close each slat to ensure privacy when in the room. - Beach area had white sand, but it was relatively narrow. I can imagine this will become crowded during peak seasons.\\Stephen in Tokyo\\Costabella Resort is a beautiful place located on a private beach. The grounds are very well maintained by the friendly staff. It's a one stop resort with everything one could want on site including a weight training gym, an excellent spa and a dive shop. There are two separate restaurants serving delicious food. They offer something for everyone. It's quite easy to sit by the pools or the beach and really relax or do other various physical activities. Finally, I had very nice conversations with several staff members. It's quality all the way.   It's not that far from the airport so if you have a car it's convenient. Without a car one needs to hire one. We didn't venture outside the resort, but don't think there's much to see or do in the local vicinity. There's nowhere to walk,\\naomi r\\1st stop in the Philippinre and was perfect, the tours we did were brilliant. The staff were very friendly also the food was very nice. Good they had buffet & al a carte options.  The room was nice too  Right beside a local beach which was so lovely to see the local lifestyle too\\Sherpa270000\\The hotel was great, The grounds clean and tidy, the staff friendly and welcoming. But our  room looked out onto a dirty wall . No balcony to sit or  to dry your swimwear.  Food was delicious and cocktails were tasty but very over priced. Especially when you add the tax and service charge. The pool was big but not enough shade and the beach was small. Overall a good experience but meals and drinks were cheaper (and better quality)  at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Cebu where we stayed the week after.\\Mariel E\\We stayed for overnight in this beautiful hotel. We are fascinated by the view and accommodation they provide. The rooms was very spacious and bright they got the vibes of natural that brings peace and calm to yourself.\\lorettahon\\Pros: 1. Get 2 pools and one private beach for the hotel. Very convenient for any watersports or activities.  2. 30 mins free for Kayak and standing paddle. 3. Staff are accommodating and helpful.  4. Room: Spacious with Spanish colonial style. Nice balcony.  5. Towel Card: Nice idea.   Cons: 1. Location: 1KM walk to the closest restaurant. There are only 2 restaurants in the hotel and food delivery is strictly forbidden in the hotel which means either have your meal in the hotel or go outside by grab. 2. It is not easy to lock the door of the hotel room. I suggest them changing the key system to an electrical key system.\\Jay3449\\When I booked this resort I didn't realise how good it would be but I was impressed from the ""get go!"" The room was great, everything worked plus excellent food and staff etc (as to be expected).  However for me the surprise was that the whole resort is smoke (and vape) free with the exception of a smoking room off to one side of the bar which was very unobtrusive. The fact that the rest of the whole resort was smoke free was an absolute joy!\\FL-WorldTraveler\\The hotel has suffered a lot with pandemic and typhoon a year ago, but they have reinvested and made improvements and are on a good path. We stayed here 5 years ago and enjoyed the stay, but this stay was even better. The grounds are a delight with lots of color and artful decor. The breakfast buffet is very good. The staff is cheerful and always helpful. We will be back in the future.\\Mark K\\This was our first stop off the plane, and after 1 week. The breakfast is amazing, fresh bread, great bacon, and real hot chocolate!!! The rooms are nice and the beach is peaceful. A very ""off-the-beat"" resort. 9/10.\\nelleyooo\\We stayed for 1 night for our Honeymoon. Starting from our arrival experience, even though we waited for our room to be ready it was absolutely fine and we were upgraded as well. The person who helped us with our luggage showed us the room facilities and checked if everything was working. Breakfast selection was huge. They prepared honeymoon set up as well. Thank you so much for the great stay in our special occassion.\\clairewalker71\\What a wonderful week we have at The Costabella Resort. The hotel grounds are stunning, my kids loved the pools and slide, snorkelling, pool tables and table tennis. It certainly kept them busy! The rooms were outstanding. Food was good (mostly small portions) staff were super friendly and helpful 24hours a day. Top marks from us!\\rebellolyn\\A good place to celebrate any event. The ballroom cates for just about any event and the managers like Malu, the general manager; Ms Marita and the booking manager; Jo Jo are all very approachable and willing to please and help your stay at this hotel be comfortable. All the staff at the restaurants, the pools, the beach just down the path and room services are all happy to make your stay the best possible. The guards at the gate,  help with transport to anywhere you'd like to go, even to the Cascino...\\saverio b\\I spend few days with my Wife in this resort, and I must say was incredible relaxing! Big room with a Super comfortable bed, big bedroom and bathroom, you can have a massage service in your room till late night! The resort is offering few Swimming pool for adults and kids, there are few restaurants and a Spanish restopub. They provide as well some extra activities like water sports and shooting.\\Danimalist\\I stayed here in July 2019 for the fourth time in five years. After not making it last summer, I am pleased to say that the things that make Costabella a fantastic place for a vacation, including the tremendous service, excellent food, and beautiful grounds remain intact. It somehow manages to be a relaxing resort, a romantic getaway, and a great place for families all at the same time. The staff at the front desk, in housekeeping, at the restaurants, and on the beach are all excellently trained and exceptionally friendly and welcoming. This time, Reyla did an excellent job checking us in, while Nino kept us informed about the hotel and entertained with his stories on the new boardwalk. It was nice to see Sir Robert still running the show at the main restaurant, as he has it\\Alvin Crofts II\\Excellent visit and experience. Service wonderful as was the food. Private ocean area very secure. Massage and Gym perfect and maintained. Rooms clean and well maintained. Bed super comfy no problem sleeping. Wifi accessible in room and grounds.   Customers well taken care of.\\Lisa P\\Costabella is a beautiful resort, well maintained and has very personable staff. The thought out decor, that showcases the tradition and skills of the Fillipino wood craft, immediately set the tone for what was a wonderful 4 night stay for our young family of 4. The staff are always busy, friendly and informative when you are interacting with them. The service in the restaurants was impeccable, as was the food. The menu showcases local cuisine as well as international dishes. The extensive smoothie menu, introduced me to my new favorite, a frozen kalamansie drink. We hope to return in the future!\\Jorieboi\\Went here last 18th June 2019 booked it through a travel site. The location of the place was a challenge because the place is on the other side of Cebu City, if you dont have a car then commuting will be a challenge, though if you dont mind paying a taxi or grab service then there will be no prob.The place is really secluded and very exclusive so upon walking down to the lobby, to the reception area it was really nice, by the way I arrived around 8pm so yeah I appreciated the night light and the transformation of the resort on that moment. Welcome drinks was offered, it was a mango juice and it was soo good seriously! Check-in was a breeze :) then we headed out to our room,the room temp was nice, comfy bed, coffee/tea maker available, courtesy bottled water, towels and\\Belle\\I would like to thank people who help me to make my birthday on your resort a meaningful one. Ive been frustrated as our tour in Cebu didn’t work as what we plan but as last resort that we will stay, Im very grateful to those people who help me especially on amending my booking dates. I really appreciate it.  The only negative comment I can give. I’ve noticed that staffs act differently if you are local or from Philippines. They are more accommodating to foreign guest.   I hope all staffs embodied the true hospitable characteristic of Filipinos.\\BrianRooney\\The property itself was quite beautiful. Service was quite good, and the food available on site was well prepared as well as quite tasty. The property is located in a rather poor neighborhood, but getting out to other areas is easy and inexpensive. Maintenance at the property is poor. We had a leaky toilet for three days and only had it solved after two visits and telling the engineer what needed to be done to solve the problem. None of the USB charging ports were operational when I arrived, but were fixed the second day after I reported it. These problems aside, my stay was very enjoyable. The private beach is a gem, the pools were refreshing and clean, the decor and landscape make for a great relaxing vibe. It was also the biggest bed I've ever seen - the ""king size"" bed in\\Jamie Newman\\We stayed here for just the 3 nights before we started touring around Palawan. The hotel staff are great. So friendly and polite. Breakfast was really good! Great selection!  The rooms are basic, but the beds are super comfy! Non smoking hotel so you have to smoke in a glass box thing. Very bizarre.   The main restaurant was our favourite and the happy hour at the bar was reasonable with great tasting cocktails!  The beach is okay. There's so much better when outside of these resorts though! I don't think I could stay here for any longer as its a little secluded, but a really nice resort non the less.\\CinCin\\A few friends and myself had a great time relaxing at this hotel. The tapas bar was super cute. They have a pool table, music, TVs and lovely decor. The huge spacious bed was very comfy. Everything was clean and we had speedy service whenever needed. We ordered room service often and it didn’t take long. However, the rice or noodles dish made a friend and myself sick. Other than that, the food is tasty! The pools are nice and the lounge areas are awesome. The beach isn’t the best but it is private. I’d stay here again.\\Athena C\\My husband and I just spent our Easter Holiday in Cebu and spent 4D3N in the Costabella Tropical Beach Hotel. We had a great time and would recommend this hotel to travelers who plan to enjoy your holiday in Lapu Lapu.   The services was fabulous, all staff were very helpful, they arranged our island hopping tour and suggested yummy seafood restaurants. We loved all !   One point to remind, the overall interior of the hotel may not be that new, it is a bit old. so in case you prefer some newly furnished hotel, this is not what you should look for.  However, we were ok and had a great time there !\\MrGrimsdale025\\Have stayed here before-a few years back & the quality is still good if not better than before.  Food at restaurant is good, especially the breakfast buffet that was included in  room price. We paid about 5.5k php per night, which is quite ok for this level of resort.  Minor downside as other reviews have noted.- This place is a bit 'out of the way' from other places, meaning you are a little 'captive' at the resort,- it is not viable to walk out to other resorts or restaurants/bars etc (unlike Alona beach, Bohol or Boracay)  but the resort has all you'll need anyway. - We liked the nice globe type sun loungers, pools etc.  You can always get a taxi easily & quickly from the reception though.  Good place for a family with kids for a few nights. Not sure i'd want to spend a week\\spiv005\\Read some of the reviews after booking and thought we’d be disappointed but far from it.   We were greeted with a welcome drink at checkin which was a nice touch. Checkin was quick and efficient.   Room was spacious with two double beds and everything worked well. Water warmed up very quickly unlike some five star hotels I’ve stayed in.   Rather than going for the higher priced buffet we ordered breakfast each day from the a la carte menu which was more than enough. There were plenty of staff do even though it was a busy period over Easter the service was quick and the food was ready quickly.   There are two smallish pools but they weren’t too busy which was good. And there was a small beach with plenty of sunbeds and you could choose one in the sun or the shade, plus there were\\Lourdes Carmen\\I tot costabella resort some kind of an old and not so nice resort but i was wrong, costabella is quite good one they have nice place, clean and well maintained surroundings, its a combination of a modern and antique resort.. they beautifully preserved antique furnitures, the only problem is the location of the resort is quite remote But overall the resort is 👍👍👍👍\\Aaronwoo\\We stayed here for a few nights during a tour of the Philippines.    The hotel is great - a lot of different options for rooms.  Good amenities.  The biggest draw back is that it is away from a lot of things, but it is a resort - pools, spa, etc.  there are things to do at the hotel.  They do offer a trip to the SM Mall for those that want to shop.   The staff is great - they knew us after the first time they served us and knew what we liked.  The restaurant onsite was good - we ate all three meals there at least once.  The restaurant staff was great.   There is a beach, but not a great one - lots of grass etc.    The area is undergoing some development, so I would expect this location to get better over the next few years.\\AntAttack\\My partner and myself stayed at this hotel for a long weekend in March 2019. On arrival, we were warmly greeted and the check in procedure was very smooth. (However it was slightly irritating that we had to wait an hour for our room to be ready as we requested an earlier check in on our reservation 3 weeks previously)  We had a deluxe pool side room which was very spacious with a fantastic rain shower.  We had some excellent meals at La Marina and Brisa restaurants. All the restaurant staff were very hospitable with a special mention to Jonathan who was exceptionally warm and friendly and made us feel very welcome.  Breakfast was fairly good but I was surprised that the watermelon was of such poor quality as it is grown in The Philippines.  On the negative side, the staff at The\\Anna G\\We had an amazing almost 2 weeks stay in Costabella. My daughter 6 years old was very happy enjoying all the facilities: pools, slide, beach, deck, playground and especially the kiddie corner where she could play with the animators while parents can rest on the beach or have the massage from Rosie (excellent therapist) at the Spa. We enjoyed a lot\\12769\\We LOVED the place!!! The staff were really friendly and accommodating. The food was good enough. The bedroom was great, including the bathroom! The grounds were really nice too.   Having said that, we just got a little agitated with the other guests (foreign). I think we were the only local guests. Sad to say some of the guests were rude - mostly from a particular Asian country. :( That was really a downer."

Attentive staff and good facilities.  Pros:  Very good buffet breakfast. Excellent clean rooms with good Sky cable TV. Very good surroundings .  Cons:  Do not pay extra for a dinner option . There is no buffet  in the evening  and the only dinner option is to choose a mediocre  plate  only with no option starter or desert The plate is either meat or fish ,rice and a kind of pickled ""orange""  despite there being different vegetable combination on the card. Very poor value  for money,\\Johnny R\\We ate at White Sands more than 35 times last year....we just ate there today and were shocked by the amount we were charged for a small can of soda...  120 pesos...we will not return until they charge fairly on their drinks...so sad...so disappointed.\\Wolfgagging\\I think this place is trying to save money and milk every penny they can out of there customers. So yes I no there was a typhoon in December but 2 months later they not advertise what the hotel facilities are available. So no tv in the room no internet in room and lucky if you find it any where in the resort.  When we checked in there was dirty plates with left over food on in the corridor was there a day later. I asked for house keeping they say government rules cannot clean until we been there 3 days now all the other hotels we stay at do not have these rules As for the swimming pool that had no water in it so how can you use that and the hotel roof top bar that is also closed so mainly you have a room in a over priced resort with no facilities  Food and drinks are so\\Dennis P\\I want to laud the management of cebu whitesands resorts for opening up immediately after the typhoon even though they suffered heavily. Its a big relief for guests like us who were looking for some place to relax our mind and de stress due to the typhoon. Good job and thank you cebu whitesands management and the whole team.\\mpmadz\\Had bad asthma and allergy attack during my stay as the ac was mouldy, filthy with black dusts so imagine breathing this air in an enclosed space. The rooms smell of either pipes or uncleaned ac. They moved us to another room which was a bit better but was still smelly.   The hot water is not hot for tub so if you want to relax in a tub youre gonna have to soak in room temp to cold water. The bed was hard and I had bad hip and back pain from the bed. I got sick during my stay. Not staying again. I usually dont write reviews or give negative comments but the basics of relaxing stay is just not there. If you want to snorel youre gonna have to go far off. The rooms are dated.   The place is quiet and green. It feels private. And the toiletries are nice. But wont be staying again.\\ItsmeKarla27\\We stay 4 nights from Mar.2-6,2018. Is it really 4star hotel in Philippines? Did you inspect your toilets in heritage wing.There is some rust and need badly complete renovation for the toilet. Beach with full of ships/bangka. There's a small place to swim in sea. Swimming pool are both good. They accept daytour for swimming. Koi ponds are beautiful. The visitors are not allowed to enter the room,if they wanted to stay in room..should pay 1800 pesos. I understand the rules but it's not really about security measures. It's about business. I already visit 4times Shangrila,but never issues about relatives/visitors entering our room. Visitor's are not welcome this hotel. The visitors are allowed in lobby or restaurant. It's about business. As a filipina wife with many relatives. We\\Brad P\\Watch Out!  Spent two nights here with family while on a longer trip to Manila.  I will start out by saying prior to us checking out we all agreed that on our next trip to Cebu we should return, however our checkout experience soured this hotel to us and we will NOT be back!  We all stayed in the heritage (older) rooms and were pleasantly surprised with the size of the rooms and the spacious bathrooms.  Although some of the soft items (towels) were well worn and were in desperate need of replacing the beds were heavenly!  It was such a relief to have such a soft and comfortable bed to sleep on!  The bathroom in our room was huge!  The most important thing, the A/C worked wonderfully!  The hotel is very close to a SM grocery store to stock up on snacks and other needed items\\JAEHHYUK\\화이트 샌즈 리조트의 신관 건물인 mabuhay wing 에만 존재하는 프리미어 룸 입니다.  프리미어 룸은 구관 건물인 헤리티지 윙 이나 코트야드 윙 건물에는 없어요. 그래서 디럭스 룸이나 그랜드럭스 룸과 다르게 100% 확율로 신관 마부하이 윙 건물로 배정받을수 있습니다.  사진은 야간에 체크인 직후의 사진 입니다. 퀸 사이즈 침대 2개가 세팅 되어 있습니다. 깔끔한 타일 바닥과 샤워실 겸 화장실, 그리고 발코니 가 있습니다.  샤워 부스의 배수가 천천히 물이 빠지는 부분이 아쉬운 부분 이지만 4스타 급 리조트 와5스타 급 리조트를 동일하게 비교하는것은 무리겠지요.   발코니에는 수영복이나 다이버 슈트 ㄷㅇ을 말릴수 있도록 조치가 되어있고요.  가격 대비 무난하고 만족했던 리조트 및 룸 컨디션 입니다.   룸은 304호 였습니다.

Theres only wifi in the main lobby area, the rooms are dirty and humid, a/c barely worked and the shower was real dirty. I guess we got what we paid for.\\Julia K\\Stayed here for a few days in February. We initially booked this hotel because of the reasonable price. The hotel was just ok...  Pros: -the pool was a nice size and great sun -breakfast was a wide variety, had breakfast and lunch foods included -great sun all day -room was nice size and fit 3 people -people were pretty friendly -did the discovery tour which was so fun, great food and views and hotel representative was great too. Would definitely recommend it!  Cons: -old ish hotel  -they count everything like towels, blankets etc (very annoying during checkout they inspect your room before you can leave. Don’t worry not stealing your old linens!!) -they said we broke a dental glass and charged us (it was not true, I feel like we were targeted because we were American.

Double bed and its spacious enough..Clean room clean bathroom daily house keeping daily complimentary water,  and toiletries and towels. The  main pool is awesome ! The other pool in the heritage area is ok too good for kiddos.  The kois are awesome ! They are huge !! I love them. The staffs are very very accomodatiing and helpful and very courteous andhelpful. The buffet breakfast has lots of choices, meat noodles, chicken, pancakes, omelets , breads, salad and fresh fruits...i enjoyed my breakfast here and leave with full tummy.  The rooftop bar has a stunning view in the area and the food is awesome! Really taste good. But a little pricey! But big servings !  The only downside is the beach area.

The room was renovated recently but the handcraft was terrible performed. The lamp on the wall  come with heavy noises when it was on, the fuges between the tiles in the bathroom where broken and disgusting water came up when you walked on the bathroom floor. The shower was overflowing the floor and the bathtub didn't work. The smell on the bathroom was not roses. The facilities and area on the hotel was to small. The beach area is very small, the beach wasn't white and the tide difference where huge ( around 500meter). We tried to change hotel during the stay, but all hotels where full due to New Year. Try to stay away from the hotel if you\\Thierry E\\Visited the resort for 6 days. After a smooth check in we were given an extremely dated room at the heritage wing while an 'Grand Luxe room' of 42 sqm was booked. The room was very small and needed to be refurbished asap - these can simply not be sold as four star rooms. Anyway, after complaning we were transferred to a better room; the one week booked with is spacious. However, bathroom needs to be renewed, it is not what you might expect of a four staraccomodation. The big pool was very good but needs maintenance also. Food served in the restaurant is very good and this also counts for the 801 'room'. Breakfast is great. Also tried the spa which is (very) costly but very good. Would consider going back there if rooms/facilities are refurbished.\\dadbod088\\Had fun during our Company's summer anniversary. The resort has a nice pool, beach, and clean comfort rooms. The resort has a jet-ski, and banana boat rides. You can also do snorkeling and go for a boat tour.\\Gregory C\\I must say the the staff at White Sands is amazing. Grace at the front desk went out of her way to accommodate us completely. We were leaving at 2 am to go to Oslob to swim with the whale sharks and she offered to have breakfasts prepared and waiting for us when we left!  One of Porter’s named Noel also gave us incredible service and even gave us a little local history lesson while driving us to the Pier!  The servers at all the restaurants are Very accommodating and friendly!   The food prices are ok compared to US currency but high compared to local.   The restaurant  on the 8th floor of the tower has amazing food!  A VERY LONG WAIT but the view is beautiful!  Regarding the quality of the food: The American steaks they serve are “BETTER”. than most I’ve had in the states! Be\\AdventuresOfZolee\\It's a nice place to stay overall despite of ongoing refurbishment works ! I was intended to book a different nearby resort but when I have seen reviews of  ongoing construction works , opted for White sand resort as could not see reviews mentioning refurb here. Seems like all nearby establishments having some works done at the same time so it's a lot of grinding and banging on walls during daytime. Check-in time is unusually late it's 3pm. Just arrived half an hour before check-in and the suite was not ready yet. Friendly and professional service at reception and a welcome drink made up for that nuisance.  The room is  nice but dated also minibar is  only a few items . There are tea and coffee making facilities but only with one sachet of coffee.  Bathroom could have\\Silverswirls\\A day use experience with Cebu White Sands was an experience worth remembering.  Though the pool was not so big, but it was enough to cool our bodies against the summer heat of Cebu,  What is more appealing was the spread of the buffet.  For the price we paid for, it was a  great treat.  Not just because of the incredible food choices, but the hospitable and friendly services staff.    The wide garden, the architectural structure, the clean toilet and bath areas are some of the touches the hotel has to offer.  Of course the rates are not that quite reasonable.  Overall, it was a good choice to spend a lazy day.\\pnghenryb\\I arrived very late and had a very friendly reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The room was big and appropriate, nice bathroom and a view to the pool. the check out in the morning went well without any problem.\\Nive P\\A cozy and nice hotel just outside Cebu centrum, in Lapu Lapu. We stayed here for three days in total. The staff was very friendly and we were treated very good. The bar in the second floor is a place to check out as you get a fine view over Lapu Lapu and you could buy some drinks to enjoy with. The hotel was a bit pricey for us, but overall a good place. The road outside the hotel can be a bit busy and irritating in terms of different type of sellers that will approach you and won´t leave you alone. However I would recommend people to visit this hotel as a short-stay option rather than a long stay.\\Dada B\\As a conference organizer with participants coming from many different countries, I was at first worried about our choice of venue and acommodation due to some reviews written here. Also, unlike the standards of other countries like Thailand, there is much to be desired from Philippine hotel and conference facilities. But I was very grateful at the end that this resort--especially the staff--did their best to accommodate our various conference and accommodation needs, and exceeded my expectations. There really is nothing to complain about here, based on my experience. Positives: The grounds are spacious, there is a beachfront, and there are two swimming pools. They are both well kept. Our conference room was converted quite nicely according to our specifications, and the sales\\Kenneth O\\Stayed just one night here. Good proximity to the airport, approximately 20 minutes by taxi. Don't use the hotel's transfer service as it costs almost 3 times more than a taxi from street.  The grounds are very nice with some amazing koi ponds. The beach isn't great and is not conducive to swimming.  No Wi-Fi in the rooms but it's pretty good in the common areas.  Overall a pretty decent hotel but definitely overpriced and could certainly do with a makeover.\\Grincoffeeman\\We stayed here with my family by recommendation of family friends. The new building is nice, our room has good airconditioned and the huge pool is awesome which my children enjoyed.there is nearest supermarket as well. Breakfast is nothing special, even omellette. The restaurant in roofdeck is a plus points as it has a nice view and good ambiance. Frontdesk needs to know proper engagement to the guest disregards of the nationality. I think korean is more important to them. That stay is our last stay, there neighbor resort is much better hospitality service and facilities.\\mikeyk64\\We arrived at checkin to be provided with instructions instead of a welcome with a list of house rules including the fact the room was booked for two persons and only two could use a room. Also a house room that visitors had to remain in the public areas.   We had arrived expecting to be housed on a semi suite next to the adults only pool. We were instead house in the main block but given a suite. The room itself was decent enough without being luxurious.  It also had for some reason a kitchen sink in an area called the reception area.  This conflicts with the fact you can't have visitors in your room.  Can't see the point in that wasted space which was very utilitarian.    The hotel on the whole is very dated and in need of refurbishment. The lifts smelled as there didn't\\NunoL2\\Nice service, good breakfast, but rooms and structure is dated, needs some refurbishment. Beach is clean but the sea is so flat and low that you can't dive. Nice place to stay but a bit expensive for the age.\\Natacha S\\Stayed 1 night in order be closer to airport( came from malapascua) smooth check in and clean quiet room. Whole resort seems calm not much ppl even though it's high season. Breakfast buffe good but not so much interesting food for lunch or dinner.

My fiancee and I booked this hotel, when we went to get into the bed, I noticed brown stains on the sheet, which was excrement. The manager came and said the sheets and room were cleaned. She basically accused me of dirtying the sheets. I then actually dropped my shorts and bent over and said look at my back side and you will see its clean. We immediately packed and left the hotel for a budget hotel. At no stage did the manager attempt to find us another room! Will never go to this hotel again!//OceanLovingCouple//Mostly good experiences with well maintained rooms, good wifi etc.  We chose it as is close to Pier to get waterjet to Bohol and half the price of Radission Blu just down the road a bit further.  Cons are noise and crowds.  There are vehicles blaring airhorns in the middle of the night and the siren from the port every couple hours. The crowds at breakfast are daunting. Checkin and checkout chaotic crowding in lobby.  Only two elevators so often must wait and will be packed in like sardines.//dabawenyo//I have stayed here for 3 nights. It is a brand new budget hotel in Cebu City, perfectly well located next to SM City, ports going to nearby islands and provinces, a bus terminal going to places with beautiful tourists attraction particularly Bantayan Island. A very busy hotel, rates include buffet breakfast. The daily breakfast is always packed. It is 2 mins walk to SM but the 7/11 convenience store at the lobby is definitely a plus factor. I am staying here again in August 2023 before flying to our final destination for our family holiday in the Philippines!//Edwin R//This hotel was good for the area. It’s always hot and muggy so a nice cool room is always good. Spacious and welcoming. The staff was great. Lots to do in the area walking or riding. Have to look for the nite life.//Sandy_Star2012//Booked this hotel last minute as a ""stop-over"".    Pros: The front desk staff were very professional. The room was ready and clean and had all the amenities needed, including hair dryer and slippers. They also have a clothes line in the bathroom where you can hang wet swimwear etc. Bed was comfortable and we had a good night's rest. It can be noisy at dawn due to the bus station just across the street.  There's a restaurant, ATM, 7-11 at the ground floor and a gym at the 6th floor.  Cons - it can get chaotic during breakfast. I saw some guests not having a place to sit. In my view, the staff should seat the guests and also have tables for 2 to maximize the space.//Run around traveller//The hotel it self are fine for a 3 star. Superior Room spacious enough with good shower pressure. Can be noisy due to group checking and talking loudly in the room corridor.   The location apart of close to the main shopping mall, nothing else surrounding there. The hotel location are not close to airport.   Breakfast time are crazy busy due to many groups traveller, my first day breakfast have over 80 to 100 schools teenagers fit into the small size restaurant. Food is below average.//Liau Yuan Wei//We stayed one night there as we returned from Bohol, before we flew off back him the next day. Location: Very close to the airport (30mins ride) and also directly opposite of SM Cebu, one of the largest malls in Cebu City.  Amenities: When we entered our room, we saw a big wardrobe with hangers and a safe to the right of us. However the safe couldn’t be used as it was permanently locked. To the left was the toilet which was pretty well equipped I would say. We each had a set of toothpaste, toothbrush and cup. An interesting thing was there was a thin string as a clothing line inside the shower cubicle. There was also an anti-slip mat too. Note that there’s no bathtub. The bedroom had 2 double decker beds that look like army bunks 😳 The sheets weren’t totally clean as I spotted//Kasumi R//Overall: 4/5 We stayed for 4 nights in the Barkada Room   To breakdown my review: 1. Facility - 4/5 - The place is clean and spacious for the 4 of us. There is hot water available for the shower. There is a bidet in the toilet. Cons for me is that there is no swimming pool in the hotel and bath tub. (though I already knew of this before booking). Also, do not book the barkada room if you have children or elderly. The upper bunk is hard to climb and each movement of the person on top/bottom shakes the whole bed.  2. Service - 5/5 - The staff are kind. Water bottles are provided daily in your room as part of the accommodations. Towels are also changed daily unless you don't want to.   3. Food - 4/5 - Breakfast in hotel is buffet. Consists of Filipino food: Tocino, Corned Beef,//Mike Finn-St. James//This was the second time that we stayed at this hotel and twice we were disappointed with the rooms given even when we had booked our superior rooms months in advance and paid online. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that our room was not available AGAIN and then was told there is only a room with bunk beds?? (Honestly unbelievable it’s not a hostel) I don’t see any point in booking any room at this hotel, it seems it’s first come first served ( Not a way a hotel should be managed). Also the woman receptionist needs more training on how to welcome guests and not look sour faced as if we are not welcome.  Another note too!! If you not up for breakfast at 6 in the morning there will not be a lot left!!//Adrian B//Caja Kitchen - Sir Khennith No Courtesy, asked for help but just instructed me to go to the entrance counter and left. Lack of desire to help and info missing. He's even using his phone while working, watching NBA updates.    Front Desk - Mr. Lindayao I started a small talk, he did not indulge/engage himself; knowing full well that it wasn't even a peak hour for checking in or check out (time check: 4:40ish). He's the same person I talked to over the phone asking if there's a bigger size for the complimentary slippers, but just said that there's none, (monotone) wasn't even bothered to maybe at least explain why there wasn't any available (though I get it since mostly stick to standard filipino size). Also, I felt being profiled by the bellboy (maybe because we came in just by//Johan Munoz//Overall experience is great!  From the front Desk to the Operation Manager are all excellent in doing customer service..  KUDOS to the team for making my stay very comfortable.  I just need to call out the attention of the resto management on their staff who received my call for room service.. she needs improvement in dealing with guest.. bit rude and unapproachable.. talking to her about my OR ( ordered food ) she just shut me off by saying.. "" Di kami nag iisue nyan dito"" - explained to her that yesterday i already had signed some OR.. instead of assisting .. she just told me."" Tanunigin ko na lang sa front desk""  -  very disappointing!    But it was a relief talking to the Operation Manager absorbing all issues and giving me assurance..   still will consider staying here in//Ian//I was so grateful that the hotel extended the lent staycation promo for me.  I stayed there for 2 nights and 3 days. The room was great - so comfy and complete.  I just bothered with the other guests' children who are roaming around and a bit noisy. I am hoping that the staff will properly orient the quests, especially with kids to avoid running, roaming, and making some noise in the hallways.   For the hallways on the 12th floor, since I stayed in a corner-end room, I observed that the floor was not that well-cleaned. And as for the free breakfast, kulang. Good thing there's 7/11 with the hotel's vicinity, I was able to buy food.   Overall, I had a comfy staycation there. Thank you.//@Mikeselaeleventwo//Check in was fast, less than 5 minutes. You'll be provided a complimentary alcohol upon arrival. No queue at all. There are hand sanitizing stations every high touch point/area. Telephone operators are also friendly. Tess stands out with a very accommodating approach and tone of voice. Well done for the manager in charge in front office department. The staffs execute their job efficiently. Therefore, they were guided properly. In addition, breakfast selection is also great! There are food barriers and only the F&B staffs are allowed to distribute the food spread. Good idea👍. All in all, we felt comfortable staying at Bayfront despite of the pandemic.  Thank you Bayfront team! ♥️ Room 609 / March 11-17, 21//BigEarTours//I had a great stay at Bayfront Hotel, Cebu.   The location is very convenient wherein it is about 30 minutes away from the airport, and right across the hotel is the MyBus terminal where this bus is also a convenient transportation service going to and from the airport.   The hotel also has 711 store and ATMS which are very convenient, but if you like to go on a heavy shopping, one of the biggest malls in Cebu is just a minute walk away from the hotel.   The food was delectable and it satisfied my cravings. I recommend their Salisbury steak and their Chicken Cordon Bleu. If you will be having the dinner buffet,  ask them if they have the Bistek Tagalog, which is really good.  Their staff is very accommodating. They always follow the safety protocols, even my dining experience//Emme_Cee_85//Please orient your security guards to be courteous of guests - after all, they are the first ones guests meet. It was my first time to stay and I was unfamiliar with the hotel that i took the wrong entry point going to the hotel. The guard was RUDE and OBNOXIOUS and did not even bother to guide me towards the correct entry point. I had to honk at him loud and tell him help me get out of the exit.  Checking out was also slow.//Car0lyn1022//I love the location of this hotel, which is just across the bus station and a big mall. The facilities are good, and there's also an ATM and 711 store beside it. However, service needs to be improved. They disturbed my sleep by calling me very early in the morning just to ask what breakfast I want? This is truly disappointing for a late sleeper like me! They could have asked during check-in or the night before. Also, I ask to borrow an iron but have to call them again to follow-up and got it after an hour of requesting it! I dont find the front desk staff friendly. She shouted at me to wear my mask in front of many people at the lobby. The only good service I got is they agreed when i ask for a late checkout, which is at 1pm. I really hope they will improve the service because i//Guido//Nice rooms, competent reception staff, frendly. Bad restaurant needs new manager and cook, food is horrible.A good reataurant would help boost occupancies in time of Covide19. I dont want to return as long....//BibiX//I did enjoy my stay in Bayfront Hotel Cebu. Edmerick/Edmer the front office desk, he’s the best! I felt his connection with his guests the way he accommodates us, you will feel that you’re truly welcome in Bayfront Hotel.   Also, Loren or Loraine and Austin did a respectable job in assisting their guests. In my experience, it was one of the best hotel stays in Cebu.   Regardless of the small hotel issues I have, the management still handled my concerns well. I highly recommend it!//Mamer N//i love the location , its across sm city cebu you can walk to it. the room is spacious , upkeep is not the best though, it feels like a bit rundown already considering its quite a new hotel. buffet was good and the hotel staff were friendly and accommodating. i love the fact they have in house spa, we had room service massage three times during our stay.//David W//Stayed for the 6th time in 2Y in this hotel. Price vs quality correct,  old rooms with smelly carpets but spacious and big bathroom with a bathtub. You need to unplug the night light to connect your phone charger to a plug. But the hotel has an outstanding security and an outstanding breakfast buffet. Checkin and checkout is super slow but all staff is super friendly and well trained.  Yes, a hotel with contradictions but I return to this wonderful hotel each time I come to Cebu."

Lattes are complimentary and you can order it from the bar.\\Ben W\\This hotel is value for your money  Busy hotel and breakfast could be improved coffee is terrible  swimming pool is nice user friendly   Close to many restaurants and food outlets  Taxi and grab easily accessible  Room staff excellent  Reception staff need more training in how to deal with the public not an easy job but professionals handle with ease\\Han C\\There were roaches in thr bathroom. Housekeeping forgot to clean our room even though we had the service light on. Breakfast buffet is a bit underwhelming and sometimes there's a long wait due to availability of tables. There is hardly any space in the rooms to place your belongings as there is a small tv stand in place of a table that most hotels have. I wouldnt stay here again and I am shocked that this hotel won some sort of travelers choice award.\\byahenijay\\One of the best hotelin Mactan Island interms of quality service this hotel didnt fail me in giving the 5 stars service from the heart from Sales , reservations, transfers to food and beverage headed by Ginafe thank you very much for the efficient service  as always oneof my favorite hotel in Mactan.  Till next visit thank you Savoy Mactan.\\Kareen V\\I stayed the night with my family for the first time at this hotel and location. The location was excellent; there are many nice restaurants and shops around. Which is what I always take into consideration while looking for a hotel. The 2 rooms we booked was amazing, so cozy and clean. This exceeded my expectations when I arrived, and it was well worth the amount we spent. Although we had a problem with the key card when we returned to our room after breakfast, but Dominic was fantastic in assisting us. Overall, we had a great time during our stay at Savoy Hotel Mactan. We will most certainly return and even recommend it to our friends.\\Mndwrkz\\4 out of 5. The Manager was kind enough to upgrade our room. The only downside is, it took so long for someone to answer the phone and for someone to deliver ice to our room. Will need to call twice to follow-up our order. I understand maybe they are understaffed. Overall our experience is superb, and will definitely visit again!\\Koko loko kim\\This is the worst hotel We’ve ever been, You’d expect this place to have a 5 star service of what you payed for but it’s far from that We checked in 2pm but unfortunately they said there is no room available so we have to wait got back 5pm  Still no room available  Finally 6pm  First room was hot as hell aircon didn’t work So asked for a room transferred  The 2nd room stinks and dusty So me and my partner decided to just upgrade our room from deluxe to junior suite!  Next day my mother in law arrived she’s in town for a day and when we did her checked in 3pm  We have to wait till 8pm just to get her room lucky we were there if not she’ll be with the rest of the guests that got their room late take note didn’t just happened to me but also a lot of people  During check out time we\\Lex O\\I was told by my friends about the promo's of Savoy Hotel and avail one of those. My experience was kinda fun and memorable. As we entered we were greeted politely by the guard with a smile, the FOA also greeted us and approach us right away, we were asked by our IDs pleasantly and check in us smoothly. All employees were approachable and very accommodating. The rooms were clean and smells good as we enter. The foods also was delicious and mouthwatering. Thank you so much Savoy for making our stay a good one and memorable ♥️\\Scarlett\\My experience at Savoy Hotel Mactan was worth satisfying, the employees was very accommodating and friendly especially the front office associates they are very polite and hospitable, the check in was very smooth and no hustle. The rooms was worth for its price and not just that, the food also that they serves and offer was delicious and worth the price ♥️ Thank you so much for the good service, hope to visit again soon✨\\ChrisA.\\It was indeed a tiring yet fruitful experience travelling to North Cebu & Bohol so my partner and I decided to look for a hotel nearby the airport to enjoy our remaining days in this beautiful province and we saw Savoy- it wasnt our first time staying in this excellent hotel but our first time in Savoy Cebu. The lobby sets our first impressions that staffs here are very hospitable and we were correct from their Front Office staff- Eilyn to the room service attendants are all hospitable with a smile on their faces. Moving to their rooms, it was spacious and provided an adequate space for people who are working remotely like us- all our new and sets on its place. Bathroom is well equipped with beyond the normal set-up vs other hotels with the same class. Food is ultimately okay\\Bliss2023\\We stayed here for 2 nights whilst passing through Cebu and although the hotel has potential, we weren’t sad to leave. On our way up the lift, we noticed a certain ‘musty’ smell which only worsened as we got into our room. Soon noticed that around the sink in the bathroom, was a ring of mould just u set the counter top and realised that the over powering smell we could smell was mould. We asked reception if we could move which they readily did for us and although the next room was much better, it still had the same issue. The breakfast was average and we ended up eating out during the evenings but for a passing through hotel, it was okay.\\Khimla B\\The front office is very friendly, smooth transaction. They are very friendly and very accommodating. When we arrived at the hotel they are already smiling at us and greeted us good afternoon right away. The room is very clean and beautiful.\\michelle z\\i stayed for one night upon checking where to stay at the last minute. i was not disappointed at all.. the check in was smooth by front desk staff Mitch and concierge Kristian Monton. they were accommodating and made me feel welcome.  even the guards on duty were very corteous in greeting too.  the location of the restaurants, supermarket, massage, church, convenient stores and starbucks are just walking distance. would love to stay here again!\\Joy G\\I stayed for 6 days and so far i had an awesome experience! Thank you Savoy for making my stay an extra comfortable as i travelled with my 23 month old toddler! The food was awesome and even rooms are quite big! (Stayed in junior suite)  Will definitely be back soon!\\Ophichius Lowis G\\The service was really good. The transaction was really smoother than I expected. The best part is the FOA, which very accommodating. They won't leave you unless you are already comfortable. They treat me like a VIP, they surpass my expectation about check-in in this Hotel. The experience stay in the Hotel is satisfying.   Thank you for the accommodation. Definitely, will come back!\\Kaisserstuff\\The stay in Savoy Mactan was excellent! We were welcomed with excellent, gorgeous and super delicious Cebuano local delicacies and menus.   The rooms are so clean and relaxing, there's a Gym, Pool and Mini-Bar. We enjoyed a lot our stay in Savoy and Cebu as well.\\Lou Gilward\\I really appreciate the Hotel's front desk for giving us a smooth and early check in unlike the other hotels out there the staff are really humble and approachable. My partner and I personaly enjoyed the welcome drink after a heavy traffic it is really resfreshing to be greeted with a refreshement. also, the room is clean cozy and comfy, Our hotel's experience is great and wonderful, might check in back soon 😊😊😊\\clamster\\Firstly I must say just how helpful, polite and efficient all of the staff were at the Savoy.  They made myself and my partner feel valued and comfortable.  I have no basis to complain about any of the core issues at this hotel. Room service, housekeeping, cleanliness and covid awareness were all top notch. The swimming pool was clean and a nice temperature and the towel service easy. Our room, on the 8th floor, was roomy and the bed comfortable.   The only area where I feel an improvement could be made was breakfast. It was rather strange in its offer. I appreciate that this is the Philippines,  but , unless requested there was no tea on offer, only ready brewed coffee. Personally I always drink tea with breakfast.  Then there were the cups. Very small to say the least.  The\\Jay Escultor\\5 STAR - GOOD HOTEL to stay  I was stressed from heavy traffic in Manila but here in Mactan, I was mesmerized with white beach of Mactan Newtown though was slightly damaged by Odette. Your staff was very active on my requests.  The room is clean and their pool has the best spot for insta-worthy posts. Thank you for wonderful experience in your hotel. Will recommend this to my collegues\\kenjee08072014\\Title : They have best service ever!  I know myself to have a lot of requests just to make myself happy especially on having staycation after my busy schedules. The food was superb and their batalla de Mactan? That was worth a try!!!!  Can’t wait to try another batalla next month and avail their promo ! ahahhaahhahahahaha .. Thank you very much for indulging me with good food and new spot to vacay in Mactan!  Keep it up!\\GraceF\\We stayed at SAVOY Hotel Mactan Newtown for 3 days and 2 nights last March 2-4. For us, this is the BEST Hotel in Mactan or even in Cebu! The way they maintain the cleanliness of the hotel is very impressive! One thing we will never forget are the accomodating and friendly staff, everytime we pass by them, they always greeted us with a nod and a smile, that's what we love most!   SAVOY Hotel Mactan Newtown is perfect for whatever ocassion you'll celebrate.   Plus, I am a GYM MEMBER since October 2021 and now I'm extending my MEMBERSHIP to SIX MONTHS 💞 That's how I am pleased and satisfied with their accomodation.  It's always great in Savoy Hotel Mactan Newtown ✨💞\\LLOYD M\\I'm so pisssed with this hotel, been here for almost a week thinking that being in your home country will give you better service versus their foreign counterparts. Yes the room is cozy good view but cleanliness hell no the bath room has hairs from the previous occupants, toilet bowl dirty (attaching some photos). Pricing of their menu is far high than surrounding restaurants, a classic example is their egg= $1, pizza $12.44, tapsilog $7.44! Truly a rip-off jo wonder so many bad reviews about this hotel.   This review is to improve the quality of service of the hotel.  So odd can't upload the pictures.\\Brahdd S\\Best hotel for your Quarantine. Staffs are  accommodating.  Especially Engineering and Housekeeping Department. If there are any concern,they can  accomodate directly. Thanks to DEAN,ART and Ritchelle for the effort..\\Dieu H\\A ruin experience on our first visit in Cebu! But the hotel made up with an unexpected service recovery in what we describe a total renew experience in Savoy. Frankly speaking, we didn’t expect such a kind gesture from the GM. We just wanted to share our mixed experience to the Outlet Manager, but it turns out to be the GM who handled us. Everything was dealt with professionally obviously! That is all we really wanted and you have successfully converted us to be your new loyal advocate. 10/10 recovery and kudos to the GM and entire team.\\reli f\\I highly recommend to stay with the savoy hotel either for leisure or business type of a visit. We are very pleased not just the location but also the staff, we stayed for over 3 weeks to this hotel and I can tell how lucky the company to have a genuine and kind staff. They’re very welcoming and you can feel that they treat their client with respect and fairly, I would like to thank all of the staff for their hard work and doesn’t look/base their treatment to all their client by what they wear or where they’re coming from (nationality). It makes us feel like home when we stayed to this hotel. Thank you and looking forward to stay with savoy in the future.\\Maria\\During our stay, the pool was under maintenance. We felt like we were quarantined guests coz there is nothing to do in this hotel. Their parking and hallways stinks coz i think their septik tank was under maintenance too. We were about to leave the hotel during the day of check in but was tired to go back home. What disappoints me is their covid safety protocol. On the night of our checked in, we were already 5 inside the elevator when the guard stopped to open the elevator to let the newly arrived OFW go with us. Luckily, the lady in our elevator said 'My God we are already full. You're not practicing the protocol' so the guard decided to let the OFW stepped out and wait for the other elevator.  During the night, aircon got humid. Their bathroom is so mall . Breakfast is just\\Chrislyn O\\This is our 2nd time coming for the Batalla Splash, and its always a feast! It's cheap for its variety and taste. Perfect combination of Filipino dishes including the lechon kawali, grilled bangus and other seafood.   Plus, we get to enjoy the pool with our kids. 😍"

The staff is amazing! From what I can remember (I'm bad with names), stand out Albert, Jun, Sam, Gisele (she made my day every morning at breakfast) and Ruby. Thank you all for a wonderful stay.\\Tegwyn S\\Thank you to Beth, Giselle and Jane for your friendly efficient service and lovely smiles making our breakfast very relaxing as well as delicious.  Really great to have breakfast included with accomodation especially when travelling with a 3yr old.  Special thanks to Wensley for the delicious specially made scrambled eggs and an omelette!\\jel mark e\\Nice hotel, food and services at the cafe. The hotel is also friendly for the senior citizens and persons with disability. The menu are good also. First timers will be definitely satisfied with the overall services of summit galleria hotel.\\Odyssey56047745898\\From the lobby, cafe summit, hallway and the hotel room- aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. Sophisticated and elegant but reasonably priced hotel.   Big room, clean, spacious, well lighted with modern design/theme. Although, bathroom fixtures maybe improved.   Breakfast offering/selection was above average. I felt the food was prepared with love because they were all tasty. The ham with mango glazed and spanish style bangus were delicious. The cafe ambience is class and relaxing and may I say comforting, as there is a positive feeling evoked to start the day.  Beth is attentive but not intruding. Her smile is warm, shy but sincere.   A pleasant stay indeed.\\Chris R\\We had our meal at cafe summit and the service was amazing. We are thankful for Jun for catering to our needs especially since we were dining with our little kids. Thanks Jun! You made our time a pleasant one😊\\Rick G\\I mostly enjoyed the restaurant, I am a very low-key person and prefer to stay in the shadows.  One waiter I'm extremely appreciative of is Sam...he initiated me with small talk, and went way beyond to make sure I was happy.  I have my laptop and am vacationing solo.  When I came downstairs to get table the other watress tell me no on bigger table.  He pushed 2 tables together to accommodate my breakfast and laptop...man! Extremely appreciative. thx 😁\\Norberto A\\Great service Vèry efficient The people there are very respectful/courteous/friendly and would initiate/attentive to meet your needs.

For the past 6 years every time I traveled to Robinsons Galleria Cebu for shopping, dining, and watching movies, I already have Summit Hotels and Resorts on my bucket list. When the pandemic broke up, with strict health protocols to follow, it was hard to travel abroad. From then on, I've decided to be a local tourist guest of my own City/Province and experience Cebuano hospitality to help the tourism industry which is badly affected.  When I was browsing were to celebrate the Chinese New Year 2022 to welcome the Year of the Water Tiger,  Summit Galleria Cebu suddenly popped up online and days after, as a pageant fan, the Philippines won the\\Torch 3\\Stayed 3 nights here. Clean and comfy beds. Good AC, right water  pressure and heater is operational despite the City was impacted by super typhoon Odette where Metro Cebu has NO power and water in many areas. Breakfast plates for now since the Restaurant Providore is still closed. Room With big sized TV, electric kettle, small ref and good wifi. Complimentary Two small bottles of water daily. Each floor has complimentary water dispenserin the hallways. Nice staff. Would recommend.\\Miyang\\So I had my quarantine with this Hotel.  All I can say is the customer service is highly appreciated, since the day I arrived until I checked out.  If I request something they immediately have an action.  The rooms was clean and the ambiance is good.  Please extend my appreciation to Mr. Jilmer Cortez.  He helped me a lot. Even buy me some medicine because my stomach felt bad! Hardworking and approachable!  For all the staffs, thank you! Salamat!\\Lc\\Superb! Had a safe, clean, and warm stay. Staff made sure to look after the cleanliness of the room a day after the beginning of the stay. Will be sure to come and will definitely try their restaurant.\\Owen McBride\\A great clean hotel with a great staff. Helpful from the time we arrived on the doorstep until we checked out. A great experience. The hotel is perfectly located adjoined to the Robinson's Galleria Mall. A very short distance away (visible in the distance) SM City, Cebu. Very very close to Pier 1 and all fast craft. The staff were very accommodating to our needs for storage space due to a variety of over-sized Balikbayan boxes. The doormen were most helpful in ""flagging"" taxis. And the PNP on the premises were a very comforting thought. The room was pristine with a great view. Thanks to the entire staff. I am looking forward to staying there again in the future.\\Ghilord baguio\\This hotel is the best in term of cleanliness and ambiance and also the location itself close to malls,churches, and Port. I did my hotel quarantine for 10 days in Summit Galleria Cebu ,my room are big with dinning area,living area, big sleeping room and Big Comfort Room, crew and staff are friendly  they are well trained about protocols and guidelines .. good job\\Ron\\I stayed here for 8 nights to quarantine as a Returning Overseas Filipino (ROI). While I cannot fault the courtesy of the staff, the food was a major letdown.  I would give better meals to the homeless on the streets. Not once during the whole stay did they serve a fruit with the meals. If you want to eat healthy and stay sane while stuck in the hotel room, I suggest that you download Food Panda on your phone and get food delivered to you from your choice of restaurants. Otherwise, the whole experience could make you feel like you are paying to stay in a fancy hotel to eat a prisoner's food. It was depressing. I did not mind eating from a disposable plate with plastic spoon and fork if this is for health reasons, but I believe that a balanced meal is essential to a person's well\\IMGlobal77749\\the hotel has excellent customer service. they respond to inquiries, concerns and request immediately. they are very accommodating. I just wish they serve better food. for a 3 day quarantine, our hotel bill is a package with 3 meals a day. but it was very small servings. for the price paid, it should have been more, with more selection and servings. apart from food, i think the hotel is good. just a little pricey compared to others. the airport to hotel transpo should also be free and included in the reservation. but they charge every single activity.\\Francis\\they have a large room, a family of three is well accommodated. the staff are very polite and friendly, the food was great as well. place is very clean and comfy. didn't had the chance to visit the pool though. internet is fast but it sometimes get disconnected.\\Mark D\\not our first time here. and not our last Pool is great Limited menu due to pandemic, yet they tried their best to accommodate... not totally disappointed  Staff makes or breaks a property Staff here is world class, above average accommodating, concerned and attentive. Very very enjoyable stay and we will go again soon\\Glenn Guinto\\The location is excellent. The room is clean. However, the Internet is really slow it's totally unusable. I used mobile data so I could work.. :(  Hot shower is not working in our room.. :( I think the shower and toilet's glass doors should swing inward, instead of outward as it blocks passage and could bump into each other.  Our booking includes ""free breakfast."" Well, it's not really free since you can book without breakfast for a cheaper price.  You don't get to choose the type of breakfast. 1st day, sausage, scrambled eggs, and rice. 2nd day, tocino, scrambled eggs and rice.  3rd day, repeat 1st day :D sausage, scrambled eggs and rice. No offence meant, but their ""free"" breakfast reminds us of the meals served in inter-island passenger/ferry ships :D To their credit, they\\Eunice Gail O\\Our stay was amazing. A good getaway from a work day.   The room was very spacious and clean. The bed waaaaaas aaaaaaawesooooooome! It was big and so comfortable. Also the room lighting and color were very pleasant to see. To add, the block out curtains are really good. ☺️\\steph_dmd\\I can attest to the great service of the banquet staff, delightful food and fabulous function hall. So thankful for Ms. Stephany Cañete for accommodating our event last sept.17 in spite this coronavirus pandemic. Our event was a success big thanks to summit staff and crews. More power to all! May you continue to fulfill and bring happiness to all that needs your services.\\aguitongleoniza\\I had a very pleasant stay with great accommodations.  Room was big and comfortable.  People were kind and always smiling.  The front desk lady was also very helpful getting a grab car en route to the airport upon checking out.\\Ricardo\\I had an enjoyable stay at the Summit Hotel because the staff are helpful, the food is good, rooms are clean and comfortable and beside a mall. I have been a guest of this hotel for several times but my last stay was the most memorable one. I have reserved in Summit Circle but was was on my mind was Galleria but although I had no reservation they accommodated me instantly. Also I forgot my cellphone charger but they have a spare charger on the front desk so I was able to charge my phone. Thanks to that..\\kiietiu\\Naiwan ko yung pera ko sa may table dun sa room , nung tinawagan ko sila nahanap nila yung pera tapos pinakuha ko nalang sa pinsan ko. Thank you so much po , highly recommended, minsan nalang yung ganyan.\\Roman III Reyes\\It's very close to my Cebu office so I stay here whenever I am in Cebu (which is about 2 weeks out of every month). Convenient because it sits atop a mall where there's an abundance of choices for meals and shopping . The mall's quite new too and has a good variety of shops for almost all your needs. The breakfast buffet is excellent also. Each room has its own WiFi router so you get a good signal all the time.  What's not so good? Really small ref in the room, and only 4 clothes hangers (they don't expect you to stay too long I guess)...\\r0mmelreyes\\i always stay at the summit  galleria every time i travel to cebu which is a weeklong stay every 2 weeks. i like its convenience to my place of work and the amenities it offers especially the shops in the mall below where i can dine and buy items i suddenly need. the breakfast buffet is also excellent.\\stiflerspeilberg\\We stayed only 1 night but the customer service was the highlight... They were so kind and helpful from the moment we got out from our van until we left... Although, there was only 1 elevator working at that time, I understood the inconvenience because they were preparing for the sinulog festival... I love that the mall is just right there... You can eat, shop anytime... i wish we could’ve stayed there for more days... Definitely one of our choices to stay in Cebu!\\Giusseppe S\\We got to the hotel at least an hour earlier than check in time but the receptionist did not make it difficult for us. she made arrangements so we could deposit our luggage at their luggage storage. Then asked us if we can allow a couple of minutes so they can check if they can allow us to check in earlier than expected. So my fiance and I just decided to grab a quick bite at the mall. Of which to my surprise, the hotel had access to where we need not go out as it was scorching hot out. After a sumptuous lunch, we can back to the hotel and our room was already ready. The room was really clean and the aircon was cold. Checking out was also a breeze.Too bad we only had time in our schedule for a one nightstay. But I would definitely be back if ever I am in the area."

We were greeted by a mild-mannered receptionist (if i remember it right, Kevin) before we hopped on the boat.  Sit on the first row, if you wish to enjoy the water splashes.  We didn't mind as we were still wearing our swimmers from our whaleshark experience.  We got there about 1pm, the room was ready about 3pm, but no trouble, because we enjoyed alone time in the infinity pool, took a nap on the daybeds, enjoyed a ""must order"" halo halo on a buko, and fruit smoothies!  What makes this place awesome is the staff, from the pool guy who picks up every leaf falling on the water, to the porters who helped our bags, to the friendly people at the reception and the dining area, even the nice ladies at the Amuma lounge.\\danilo b\\It's lovely to be on this island for the first time. especially when I go scuba diving. I had a wonderful time. The staff is excellent. The food is delicious. I intend to return to this place. Sooner.\\Mar D\\Kudos to all staff! Service is above and beyond.   We had a wonderful experience here at Bluewater Sumilon Island Resort. Villa rooms was perfect and private. The staff was amazing and went beyond to make our stay enjoyable. We definitely recommend this place.  Activities include everything worth seeing around the area. No worries if you can’t snorkel. They will teach you and provide equipment. The staff pays paramount attention to your safety. The coral reef is beautiful. Swimming and kayaking are fabulous. Worth every penny. Special thank you to Chef Jeffrey for the amazing Philippine cuisine. Also special thanks to Yuri (FO), Louie (HK), Roxxane (Dining), and to everyone who made it feel like paradise.\\Dharma Raj D\\I availed there day pass package of Php2,000 and it comes with free boat transfer from the mainland to the island.

Room accommodation, yummy food and excellent customer service completes our stay here on what we called paradise. A lot of activities, we have also enjoyed during our stay. Thanks to Bluewater Sumilon for a one of a kind experience.\\Doris\\Amazing views everywhere on the island. Rooms were really clean , spacious and all ocean view. The bathroom was gigantic, modern with natural lighting from the huge sky lights. Wifi and A/C was flawless.  The main restaurant serving breakfast and dinner had great ambiance.\\Sh8\\Such a lovely day trip we went again for a second day. The snorkeling here is great so I can only imagine the dive would be too. You can pay to use the resort for the day and you get access to the beach, swimming pools, buffet lunch, equipment. You can also trek or ride bikes here. You can also just pay to visit the sand bar to swim too.\\Selina M\\I had heard a lot about this resort and had originally planned a day trip, last minute we decided to spend one night.   The property and the room were amazing! The views are obviously incredible all around because it's an island of it's own. We also did some snorkeling off the coast which, although was beautiful, was not regulated to standards I would prefer. You can literally walk on the coral and destroy it as much as your heart desires.   The hotel itself was over-priced for what was offered. The service was also lacking. We had just come off of four days spent traveling around the Philippines islands staying in places much cheaper, with much less to offer, with way better customer service. There were multiple times we had to wait 10+ minutes for drinks when we were the only\\Kim J\\I would like to commend all the staff of Bluewater Sumilon Island Resort.

I brought my whole family, it was our first stop from a very long flight..perfect to relax and the food was superb! The boat ride to the island was good. My kids had a great experience of kayaking and fishing at their own pier. The beach was great.. the water condition was a bit rough at that time, but we had fun at their pool. I was a bit disappointed when we could not gone to the sand bar, the weather was not nice.. but I will definitely come back in this island of paradise. I would highly recommend bluewaters sumilon island to my friends.\\Shee Rah\\A perfect hideaway for relaxation. We love the serenity of the place, the people there were very friendly and courteous and the food was consistently delicious. Beautiful scenery, peaceful ambiance. Great place to relax and fall in love.\\Joy_n\\This place is simply excellent. This island resort offers everything that a 5 star resort provides but at the same time experiencing the serenity and calmness of true nature. From the front desk manager Ms. Elvie, to All her staff, spoils guests by providing a personalized touch to their service. Both restaurants found at the resort have affordable prices and good food. The three days we spent here went by very quickly because of the various nature inspired activities. No complaints here. Just a big thank you. And we will surely come back next year. I hope that other tourists can discover the beauty and tranquility of this island  No need to go further.\\Arnoud\\Yes it is expensive, but yes it is a wonderful place to relax.   The staff are friendly and welcoming, the rooms are comfortable and clean, and there are plenty of activities such as fishing, kayaking, pedal boats at the lagoon and snorkeling on different sides of the island. We stayed here for two nights with our two children (8 and 5 years old) and we never got bored. There is a separate infinity swimming pool for in-house guests, and another swimming pool for all guests.   The food is fine: they have the best club sandwich we have ever tasted in Asia and every evening there is a themed dinner buffet. We had China and Seafood: the first we found better and tastier than the second, but it looked super good and well cared for.   All in all quality for money, especially when you\\Dalamar66\\Food was great, ceviche, sushi, seafood... awesome views and many things to do, from kayaking to fishing and of course snorqueling around the sandbar.  It is well worth it the price tag, looking forward to repeat!\\Stella D\\Bluewater Sumilon Island Resort did not disappoint! From beginning to end, our stay was delightful. The staff was very accommodating and very pleasant. The food was fantastic. The place was very clean and well maintained. Did not expect it for a big island resort but they did a pretty good job. The views from the island are unbelievable, the sand bar was picture perfect, the activities are available if you want to leave a island and be adventurous. I highly recommend staying here if you want a true R and R.\\Kat\\This place is amazing! It’s not the techiest place in terms of keycards and such but the internet is fast. My husband works online doing videos and the internet did not disappoint. Now on to the best bits...  1. Room was so spacious and comfortable. The bathroom is on a whole other level. It’s a room all on it’s own. It seemed to me that all the rooms have a sea view. Or at least most of them. It can comfortably fit a family of 6 with extra mattresses. But is incredibly spacious for 4. The beds were so comfortable and the bathroom had a bidet! If you are looking for razors, bring your own. :)  2. The amenities/facilities are simply breathtaking and wonderful to be a part of. Sumilon island is a marine sanctuary. They have activities that promote this. So much to do with a\\Lantmanna\\We Analyn and I took 2 nights here at the vila 15.... good location and near the beach on the island.....but so far it’s good until we sitting down for dinner... it’s a buffet and lots of Choices..... but unfortunately the cook/chefs has make mistakes of NOT using salt/pepper even the shrimp does not taste...... bad, really bad.....so plymake you’re choices.....\\LightPacker824505\\Pros - picture postcard blue clear waters + the sandbar.  - Not many chalets so a good get away from the crowd - Reasonable value for what you get  Cons - Day travellers but that's what helps to sustain the reasonable price you pay while staying at BW Sumilon - Low numbers of pax also means low variety of food during buffet time.  All part of the deal\\Shebenlee\\Absolutely loved my stay here. We did the glamping. It was amazing. We had the whole beach to ourselves. The food was spectacular, buffet breakfast was the best. We had our own private dinner for two. The staff were very friendly and accommodating to any needs you might have. The snorkeling was really beautiful, so many beautiful fish and corals. It truly was an amazing experience. I hope to come back again one day.\\Jan\\Waters are clear and blue. Marine life not bad if u snorkel. The sand bar is nice but crowded with day travelers. The resort is value for money as they include 2 way transfer n ferry.  The 4 hours car ride from airport is worth the experience.\\wanita.banana\\Living the island at its finest here. Picturesque Scenery was in every corner. The sandbar is definitely a must experience here. Its very fine white sands was also very enticing. The staffs are very polite, too.\\Nhagz\\Last December of 2018,we went to Bluewater Sumilon Island with some of my blogger and media friends. We stayed their spacious room and the ambience was really good. The vibe outside is stunning. Their food was great and the staffs are truly well-trained. We enjoyed so much with our stay at the resort.\\richie880\\We join the day tour.  Price has increase to 2500 pesos either day of the year, be it weekends or holiday.  The boat arrived at the sand bar, the sand bar is for all people, don’t expect it to be a private property of the hotel. Day trippers comes in and out from their boat.  From the sand bar you need to go up to reach the resort.  They have a golf cart waiting for you to take you to their property.  From there you need to walk down to reach the main activity center, swimming fall, main dining hall, lagoon , beaches is not that swimmable in this area, your better off swimming in the sand bar area.  Lunch menu is so so, more on meat.    The services of the staff is good here, that’s the only good point.  Will I come back?  No, once is enough for this place.\\happy traveler\\Worth the long travel. Waves at the private beach were too strong due to the weather, but the water around the sandbar was beautiful and there were plenty of things to do. The island is beautiful, with lots of visiting baby sharks. Service is excellent. Friendly, accommodating staff. Special thank you to Chef, who fixed us lunch on a very, very short notice!\\EndlessTravels\\Apart from the mass of day trippers on island it’s a fantastic and beautiful spot to stay. The scenery is picturesque and the resort looks after you very well. Would recommend to my friends without a hesitation\\MeyaTM\\Came to this place wth my hubby and kid,to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  From their holding area in the mainland til every staff we met in the resort, everyone had been so courteous and always on standby to assist u on ur needs..plus they provide not just the usual staff guest convo..but i say personalized convo snce most of them would proactively give u info and details so ul have a better idea how to have an awesome resort experience..buffet food is superb,worth the price..the infinity pool for in-house guest needed some repainting, but it has the most picture-perfect view..deluxe and premier deluxe rooms have beautiful view.  We surely would come back to this place, coz this d only resort we visited by far where we felt much privacy and treated fairly well (although"

Particularly, one male concierge was excellent. I remember his name, DOLF, I would like to comment how I pleased was with the service given by him. He is the best concierge ever. I really made my day thanks to him. Many thanks.\\Michael J\\It used to be good but since Covid it has gone downhill. The rooms are getting tired, the lobby needs work, the staff need better training and it needs new management and an investment. Last time I stayed I had a cold shower for 5 days straight even though every day I was told it had been fixed. Management is obviously very poor and this shows. I have stayed there 12 times but never again.\\Czar Emmanuel\\While this remains as one of the well-known hotels in Cebu City, particularly in Lahug area, it is clearly old and needs renovation. The ground floor is okay, with very few but nice shops and restaurants, but the upper floors, especially the rooms, show clear signs of deterioration. The carpets were stained, some furniture's upholstery was also old, the headboard of my bed had some torn canvass, some parts of the lampshade were peeling off, etc. WIFI was also weak, and the conference rooms were not soundproof. We had a three-day function in one of the conference rooms on the second floor and we could hear all the noises coming from the other conference rooms. The swimming pool and the gym were small. The elevators were very slow. Lastly, the menu of the restaurant near the lobby\\Rodel of Betterman Tours Bohol\\Approachable Front officers, big parking, huge massive lobby, Hotel location is at its best. Near and even walking distance to IT park where you can find more dining places. Not far from Malls. Nice to held and event with big function halls and breakfast is a must.\\LKJE\\We stayed here for the for the first time four years ago and I loved it. This time we used it as a base in cebu  for a 4 week tour. It fell short unfortunately. It is looking a little tired  now, the pool area has a derelict waterfall that is taped off, the rooms are hit and miss in quality too. One night we stayed in 1411  and it wasn't until we were on our way to Danao port my wife said I was bitten all night by something, were you?. Er, no!!. And if I was I wouldn't have stayed in the bed. I'm not saying there were bed bugs in our bed but only when she sprayed her legs in 50% deet did it stop. Final day we stayed we didn't get a room until 16.15 having arrived from the camotes island at 13.00. Shame as I really liked this place. The only people getting booked in were ones for\\WombatAussie\\We regularly stay here because of the great price, service, and fantastic breakfast. But we can highly recommend the buffet dinner too. We had a small complaint that there were none of their fantastic muffins for breakfast and to our surprise we found a box of muffins was delivered to our room -  this says that they know that ""little things can mean a lot"".\\Nathalie N\\Not impressed with this hotel. Would not return. I did a last minute, literally booked this the day before, trip to Cebu. Not much hotel availability anymore at that time so I picked this one. I figured a 4 star rated hotel with a casino and nice pics should be nice. I was not a fan of this hotel, and I don’t need much fancy at all. Upon arrival, the lobby is huge and looks nice, but it was smelly. It was very clean but the smell didn’t want me stay in the area at all.  The room was just ok. The bed wasn’t very comfortable, but ok.  The bathroom appliances were old and my shower pull bottom from switching from bath tub mode to shower mode was stuck so I only got have the water shower. I didn’t bother asking for new room or getting this fixed. I made due.  Casino was boring. Lots\\RaSha\\I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in May 2023. It was a good stay. Rooms are reasonable in size for a four star hotel. Buffet breakfast was OK , the choices average. Staff were polite and helpful. Centrally located. I would be happy to recommend this hoel.\\Rinku P\\Stayed in for 1 night. They don’t live up to their brand.  - Checkin experience was average. They had only 3 desks open for checkin. Resulting in people standing in queue for more than 15mins.  - Pool area definitely needs maintenance. Broken chairs, chipped tiles, slippery areas.  - Bar at the pool - Don’t come with any expectations. Only selective beer available. No cocktails or wine by the pool.  - Drinks inside the hotel - strictly ok. Again very few options.  - Restaurants- they have several restaurants serving different cuisines like Italian, Japanese, Chinese etc. Being a vegetarian (no meat no fish) we wanted buffet option. There was nothing that we could use except bread. So we ended up eating Italian. Quality not upto mark with price and hotel name. Breakfast buffet\\Claudia D\\The shower was third world, dated and dirty room. I booked the wrong waterfront hotel. I meant to book the one across from the airport and booked downtown instead, try to change booking, spoke to a very rude registration person called Leti asked for manager she said manager was on vacation. The place is pricey and a hell hole\\Jonathan\\We recently spent three nights at the Waterfront while conducting some business at the US Consulate located downstairs.  Despite the limitations imposed by the pandemic,  we found the food and staff service to be first rate. They are striving to provide a guest experience that is as stress free as possible under all the circumstances.  I salute the staff and management for their excellence!\\Albert Chan Paran\\Waterfront Cebu City Hotel and Casino is a 4 star hotel located within easy reach of key business, commercial and shopping districts of the Queen City of the South with 561 well appointed luxurious guest rooms and suites, which includes 13 Ambassador Rooms, 10 Ambassador Suites, and 1 Penthouse Suite. It has a huge casino, 10 restaurants and bars/lounge, full service spa, wide outdoor pool, health club, conference center, branded shops, daily housekeeping and 2 grand ballrooms perfect venue for shows, concerts, and events. Truly a stunning landmark and great City landscape at the beating heart of Cebu City.  Time and time again, every time I gaze at the structure of this hotel from the City's thoroughfare, it reminded me of the famous Disneyland Castle and it made me smile by\\charl0ttestuck\\Air conditioning was a problem which made us move rooms several times. Placement of curtains in the shower was not well thought of because water would still soak the bathroom floor even if the curtain was properly closed. I would call room service or housekeeping and even operator several times and they wouldnt pick up.\\tundagkent19\\Food was very good and we will always come back for that. The managaer was very generous to upgrade our room since the aircon was not functioning well. But, the pool attendant was kinda rude and some food servers are kinda unattentive. But overall it was very good.\\j0celynbustamante\\Any business or establishments defined on their excellent customer service. Customers are loyal because the best experienced they received, and I am one of those customers. The values and the frontline team members made the Waterfront the best place to stay in Cebu.\\Coachjugz\\I love the fact that the hotel and the staff is vmchild friendly. I didnt even have to ask for a bowl of cereal for my child. The room is big and spacious and clean. I would love to come back for another staycation with my family one day.\\mysteriousdebz\\This was just an overnight staycation... Staff was accommodating and breakfast was good! however, wifi and tv cable were intermittent... other than that, everything was good. i highly recommend this hotel...\\Rhonareta\\I rate it excellent because the services were all good. From security, front desk, food and etc. If given a chance to recommend a hotel to anyone who like to travel. I would gladly recommend this hotel.\\jeancoke21\\awesome and very convenient place to stay in... due to pandemic they don’t have buffet so they serve breakfast set at a very low cost and love their American style meal set. Recommended place to stay in the city.\\jaysontipontipon\\Room reservations, amenities, and all are EXCELLENT. My stay in Waterfront was very worthwhile and noteworthy. If I will be given the chance to choose a hotel to stay in the future, I will always choose Waterfront. But there's one thing that I weren't that satisfied, there was this one young lady who was one of those who serve our snacks that was so moody when serving. Other than that, everything is excellent. Thank you for the accomodation, Waterfront, Lahud Branch!\\Perry B\\We had a good time at this establishment and found it comfortable and well serviced. The staff were very pleasant. The swimming pool was the perfect place to retreat to amid the  mid autumn warm weather last year. It was a particularly good one!\\Daphne\\Due to the Pandemic our company let us stay here for a couple of days to prevent us from getting infected since i live far from my office. All of their staff has a pleasing personality.. From the gardener, security, receptionist, buffet area..and even their chefs..  amidst the crisis, you can still see them smiling and addresses your concern in a pleasant way..   Thank you for your service...\\Persephone\\For so many reasons... Room rate P5k 1 No bidet - reported on the first day. I was told that all standard rooms don’t have bidet. Guess what? My friend is in a standard room with bidet. I was then told that not all rooms have bidet. Yung totoo? 2 Slowest internet connection any time of the day or night. 7mbps download, 2mbps upload. I started watching an hour film around 1AM. I’m still on 00:53 at 4:53AM. Lol 3 AC issues - also reported on the first day and we’re already on our 10th day. I did multiple follow-ups but they simply don’t care.  4 Power plugs and or sockets are far from where it should be. Don’t expect to use your phones while lying down and charging. Or bring your own extension wires if you still want to check in here.  5 Food...insanely expensive, mediocre taste.\\kwagatsuma1121\\i tried to book a 2nd night from your hotel internet sight directly, but it was impossible because of credit card authority. i could book from Expedia by same card. i think there is some trouble in your sight.\\marvinbernardino2020\\Your hotel is highly recommended to other persons/travelers who want to stay and experience the beauty of CEBU. Thank you for the good service and Delicious foods (Breakfast Buffet). Have a Blessed Sunday Morning :)\\Glicel Ann P\\The staff is very friendly, helpful and professional. In the heart of Cebu city and near IT Park, this is a lovely hotel. I love the colonial feel to it. The room are spacious with good facilities. The hotel has a lot of places to eat. I will never forget that i saw one of the most famous artist in ABS-CBN, Ian veneracion, Vina Morales and Morissette. I was so happy that time. And now i know that this hotel has a lot of artist to go there.\\Ronnel C\\Great atmosphere, several nice onsite restaurants to choose from, good breakfast buffet no matter where your from they have something for you. Rooms were very nice, I had the executive suite. Hotel staff was very helpful. Almost everything you need in one place. Close to the Ayala mall, and the in hotel stores were nice as well.\\Roel\\From Mactan Cebu International Airport, tell the taxi driver to drop you off at Waterfront Cebu City Hotel and Casino in Lahug , about a 35-minute drive and conveniently located across Cebu’s IT Hub, the Asiatown IT Park. The hotel is also just ten minutes away from the premier shopping malls and hottest lifestyle destinations.  The waterfront hotel is very comfortable and also the employees is approachable and kind. Soon I’ll be back here.\\Farrah G\\We were there just for an overnight layover. We are very pleased as we were upgraded to the Ambassador Suite for free. Amenities are a bit dated but still very clean. We were hoping to use the pool but it was a bit crowded that time of year.\\Adam S\\Some good (if pricey) restaurants to choose from with good food. The lobby looks great and the ambient music from live performers is a nice touch, though the saxophonists especially were pretty pitchy.   Some general requests which were outside the norm resulted in some quite intensive questioning by the staff (for instance my wife just wanted a slice of bread without anything on it, and iii took a good 5 minutes for the staff to understand this) and the staff weren't particularly attentive in the lobby lounge, but in general the place was fine.   It's not particularly close to anything except IT Park, be prepared for a lot of traffic to and from the airport."

A summary of our experience is as follows.   1) Staff: Very good! Attentive. Polite. Very helpful.  2) F&B: Very good.  3) Pools: Good! Except that the main water attraction was closed for maintenance until the second last day of our 6 night stay.  4) Rooms: We had two rooms. One for us and one for parents and cousins. In a word, the rooms are tired. They need an upgrade, especially the bathrooms! The shower and basin are old. The shower heads are not comfortable, at all. The water in the bathroom is salty. We did not receive an explanation as to why this is. Hot water in the bathroom is sporadic. The door to our hotel room did not close smoothly (the edge needs to be shaved).   I believe Solea Mactan\\Raja M\\This hotel is more than 4 stars hotel you will experience the 5+ stars if you booked a room , along with the best crew at earth restaurant specialy Ivony she was so friendly  and most welcoming also all the staff was friendly.

Thank you for all you are doing.\\Catelyn B\\We had an unforgettable experience with my friends, and we really enjoyed ourselves. The service was excellent, and the staff was very kind. From the accommodation to the amenities, everything was really, really great.\\Tourist02008437198\\Best staycation we had with the family. They have many swimming facilities which my nieces truly enjoyed. Plus the front desk were very accommodating and helpful with our inquiries. The ambiance of the resort is so relaxing. Truly a home away from home  Definitely will go back here and will stay more nights! 😍\\Kishna S\\Upon our arrival is Solea Mactan I already informed them 2 days before our booking date ( August 26, 2023) that we will be having an early checked in since our arrival in the airport is too early. From a very tiring travel I was disappointed when i got into the front office when they told me that we need to wait until our room is ready, and we waited from 10am until 11:30 am for our room l, we we’re told that the room we book is still not ready and that pisses me off and my husband.   While waiting for our room, we decided to go in the bar to have some drinks to cool down and snacks, the only person that makes our day less tiring and greeted us with a very warm welcome and very positive smile was Blance upon our dined in bar despite of him being busy every time someone\\Queenie T\\A Perfect place to relax and unwind with your family or friends.Rooms were clean and the food was great👌🏼staff here were very accommodating and helpful.They have a lot of swimming pools in which you and your fam can enjoy.We will surely come back here soon!!

All the staff are very accommodating ,respectful and friendly ! Room is clean, food is great  . Will definitely comeback here soon. 💕\\travlmom7\\The parking was too far from the entrance but it had direct access to the elevator for the rooms in the new building. The layout of the resort felt like it was not planned well. From the front desk to the new building for the rooms, you’d have to pass through two ramps that are exposed under the sun or rain. During our stay it was rainy so we passed that several times and it was always wet and muddy. No staff in sight to maintain the area. This also made the elevators always wet and muddy. I had to call maintenance for them to at least mop the floors of the elevators. The corridor to our room felt old and not maintained well with dirty windows, broken mirrors, finger / hand prints on glass walls. When you enter the room you’d instantly feel the floor to be sticky. There wasn’t\\sand b\\Too much stress in 3days!  -Check in time is 3pm but they managed to checked us in at 4pm! 1hr late? Hello!! Rooms should have been ready bcoz check out is 11, plenty of time to get it done!  -no waiter service by the pool, you have to walk all the way to the lobby to order drinks/snacks!! Not convenient for us specially we have kids - go somewhere save yourself the stress :)\\Grace San Juan\\NOT for Seniors. Resort is farthest end of island. DONT book online, they assign lousiest room with view of garage ( where the delivery cars fumes ), Book directly, ONLINE booking removes privileges, Airport Shuttle, BF, No Seniors Discount. When we arrived, SURPRISED to find they Offer half price to their locals ( they call it sudden ANNIVESARY), with lots freebies ! LOTS locals crowd the resort--mostly speak Cebuano dialect. MOving around is hassle, Great if you have little kids. Dirtiest Beachfront\\Mary Jed B\\The food are superb, place is very nice and I really appreciate the service of Mario and Lovely they have the great and very professional service. Very accommodating and they even did extra mile for us. Definitely we will come back.\\jeah banate m\\We had our best accommodation at Solea last week. Me and my friends decided to have summer outing and spend overnight to relax and skip the chaotic world that we are living (especially from work). Solea became our stress reliever and they have a lot of activities that you may enjoy beyond expectations. Referring to water activities that gives us wonderful experience (aquaventure with big bucket of waters, inflatables, stand up paddle and kayaking), and the foods are worth it. We are so welcomed by the staffs and they are so kind with smile on their faces 🥰. Guest Services are well accommodating specially for our concerns, they assisted us well and provided our request in less than 10 minutes. Already recommended to each of our families and will be visiting again soon.\\Jane B\\The entire resort is Perfect for couple and Family. The breakfast is superb, there’s a lot food choices. Our room is big, we had fluffy pillows not 2 but 4😍. We enjoyed a lot during our stay, good for staycation.  In addition, we had a chill night in their rooftop restau bar which you can view the entire Island.\\Mika O\\I just want to share my experience how accommodating Solea Mactan Resort is. When I went there, it was very relaxing and chill. They also have a lot of enjoyable facilities. Overall I was really satisfied to their service.\\GoPlaces39975854287\\The solea mactan hotel was very pleasant it was clean and cozy.. The hotel team has always been friendly, patient and helpful i recommend this hotel also very nice place. The service was exceptional as well.\\Menchel S\\Personalen är trevliga men det saknas kompetens & service känsla. Fruskosten  är de värsta jag har varit med om, kön stryker sig 100 meter till frukost entren. Väl inne efter ca 30 min väntetid, så kommunicerar personalen med walkie talkie på hög volym som skär i öronen. Övrigt var frukost ok. Finns bara 2 hissar vid entren och de är varma o kvavt liksom gångarna till rummen.  Its strange: We were asked to email Solea info desk confirmation that agoda emailed  us. They apparently  ask all guests to do this as agoda isn’t linked with their system. Where is the GDPR?🤣 It was irritating so far no one asked us to mail the booking cfrm from agoda to their info desk. Not even Bayfront🤣.  The Spa treatment in Solea is superb! Floor is always wet in the lobby as well as the elevators\\JASON R\\I had a great time spending my days off at Solea with my wife. I had a good experience staying there. Good food, nice ambiance and the staffs were very accomodating. The pool was nice too. I highly recommend Solea ❤️.\\delilah m\\Beautiful experience/clean resort/nice amenities/courteous staff/sumptuous breakfast/hotel rate just okey/ will definitely go back.  Only one comment:  see-through partition between sleeping areaThese are some of the most dangerous borders in the world... and bathroom not a good idea even if it has a cover.  The cover should be made permanent - not just a venetian blind.  Privacy is topmost priority for me.\\JS R\\Josem, Bryan, Rose, Roxam, Vanz, Lovely, Hea, Joyce, Mario, Rolpan all provided excellent service. The food was great, but they really elevated the experience with their kindness and quick service!!!!!\\현지 박\\Everything was really good except for the towels and bed sheet. There were many Koreans so if you don’t speak Korean, no worries.  I did enjoy food and drinks especially the pizza at the rooftop bar. Hi Alexis and Mario :)\\Jeremy B\\I had a great time in Solea Mactan. From the amenities to the staff as well as the food, they offer the best so far comapred to other expensive resorts in Mactan Cebu. My family, especially my little one enjoyed the water park. I would definitely consider coming back to this resort when I return to Cebu again.\\huntertwinkle\\Had my birthday dinner and reserved a private room.   The facilities were ok but too crowded,  especially outside the function area. Many pools to choose from but the crowd made it un inviting to use the facilities   Didn’t go by the beachside as it was pouring cats and dogs\\Jonas Bing\\I was planning to give this place 5 stars, but I changed my mind due to an experience I will tell you about. I normally don't write anything negative, especially not about a nice place like this, but this experience was just to stupid. We been to this place a couple of times, it's really excellent. Nice rooms, nice service, great food, outstanding pool area.  We been eating in the restaurant several times, when we stay here before and also this time. They really have a high standard. We had a very nice and serviceminded waiter named Hermes, he's nice, smiling, and understanding, Solea, you better keep this guy😊 Today we want to spend the day on the hotel and let the kids enjoy the facilities. We have a family room, and we get a voucher for 4 persons (already a little stupid,\\Joe M\\Solea Macatan  Staff, are fantastic but most noticable is the staff at Sandy Beach are exceptional.. The Capt,  Mano as well as Joseph, Joshus and (Navone) (my spelling is lousy, my apology) are the best. Awesome personality awesome service.

The cocktails served at the hotel bar, especially the East Jungle, were excellent, and the original food was very good. Our English is not perfect, but the hotel staff was sincere and flexible in considering our requests regarding our room and luggage. The location of the hotel was excellent and we enjoyed the clean sea and the pool with its spectacular view. I wholeheartedly recommend it.\\maricris g\\It was a great place to go with family. The room is big good for 3 persons. It has balcony which you can see the beach. Wifi is fast.Buffet was fine,for me t’was not that huge choices but the pastries is superb. Lobby is so clean and furnitures is comfortable by renowned furniture maker Kenneth Cobonpue.Beach closes at 5pm and pool closes at 7pm..\\Denise S\\I think the best highlight of it all was the staff esp the reception. They managed to fulfill our request by upgrading my parents' room to one with an awesome view. They understood that one of my family member's were celebrating their birthday here so it was a nice touch that they gave us the room plus the option to check out late! The whole place was clean and up to date (I think this place is relatively new). Also helps that you're near Mactan Newtown so you have a ton of options to go out and eat\\Leavel N\\The sea view was spectacular.  The staff was very attentive and made us feel welcomed. I have already recommended to my friends and colleagues to stay at the Reef. Amazing time. I will visit again for sure\\Yuka T\\The infinity pool and all facilities they  offered to us was excellent. All staff has warm hospitality.  The shower annexed pool was a little cold for us. But it’s fine because except for that was great.\\Grace R\\Our stay at The Reef was an unexpected phenomenal experience!  The hotel offered a relaxing atmosphere, the rooms were clean and spacious.  The breakfast selection offered a wide variety of sumptuous food, offering delicious selections of pure Filipino breakfast with an offering of menu palatable to other non Filipino guests.    The staff were all welcoming and friendly, with attention to our needs during our stay at your hotel.   Overall, our stay created long lasting positive and relaxing experiences that will encourage us to visit and stay at your hotel.   We plan to come back with our entire family including our children and grand children from the states.   The Reef is the place to be in Mactan Cebu.\\Angel A\\The breakfast is excellent. We also tried dinner and the food is delicious. We got a free room upgrade from deluxe to premier seaview with balcony. We are very lucky and thankful. They said they do room upgrades randomly and we were chosen. The room is very spacious with bath tub and balcony over looking the sea. The beach and the sea is great for swimming.\\Angely A.\\Got a day tour to see if the rumors were true about this place having a good beach, and the rumors are true. The food was good and staff was really accomodating at the Kitchen. Special shoutout to Jaybee and Keith for making my stay enjoyable!  Hoping to stay here next time!\\hlcg6442\\Very friendly and accommodating staff. The service is good and the breakfast buffet was really delicious. The amenities was satisfactory and kid friendly. The rooms were very spacious. Hope to be back someday.\\Benedict H\\The place was stunning and beautiful. There are a lot of instagramable parts so you can have a lot of pictures with you after the visit. All of the resort staff were very friendly up until we have checked out.\\Lazy Days\\Very nice resort, as recently opened some final construction in common areas still ongoing but really enjoyed the stay.   Restaurant served really delicious food.  What makes the place amazing is its greatest asset, the staff. Big thank you to Rose in reception who is super sweet, Ariel at breakfast always ready with the coffee, and Mark T at the beach area. Hope to see you again!\\Henry_G99887\\I checked in for 8 days at the reef and was assisted by the warmest staff and crew. The view is sensational. The breakfast is superb. But what stood out the most is the concierge who assisted me since day one. He recommended restaurants and tourist spots. He was driving excellently, very unobtrusive and also the ride has always been smooth with Clint. Clint along with his team makes me wanna come back soon. I am from Hongkong, but while i was in Cebu. I felt like it was my second home. Kudos!!!  Also, suggestion: Please have a convenience or guest center and gym in your facility because it is dark and far to go out from the resort and any emergency necessity purchase might come in place. Doorbells on rooms would help too. all in all it was great but it would've been greater.\\Emeni S\\Very good hotel with excellent staff specially Mr Clint Everything was perfect , room , restaurant , view etc  Thanks and see you soon  Amani & Amani  Un excellent hotel sur tous les plans  Merci à tout le staff et spécialement Mr Clint   A bientôt   Amani & Mohamed\\Dominic A\\I had a fantastic time staying at this resort. I enjoyed the amenities, swimming pool, massage and restaurant. Hotel staff were nice and friendly. I met one of the concierge, Clint, he was very helpful and assisted me with my stay and travels. I would highly recommend this resort. The room i stayed at was nice and clean.\\Desiree jane O\\We spent there 3 days for vacation and it must say that everything was excellent and the location of the hotel is so private that why it relaxing and  the atmosphere of the hotel is so good..

We couldn’t wait to return since our first visit was so wonderful and memorable! From the moment you arrive at the resort you really feel like a VIP guest, not only yourself but your entire party will be treated equally special by all the staff. The resort in on a beautiful beach with many water activities in the sea, or you can just relax at one of the three magnificent pools. The resort is brand new and every inch is clean and breathtaking! The rooms are elegant and comfortable with great views of the sea and cityscape. The restaurant, coffee shop and room service food is great. All in all great place to vacation while in Cebu.

We really enjoyed our vacation..!The hotel are so nice, quiet & relaxing... Everyone is friendly.. the staff in Spa , the Kitchen, and even in the pool.. they are really accommodating...

Hope to see u again Guys..! God Bless..!💖💖\\airaadna\\I visited the place last December and I couldn't help recommending it to my aunt and uncle when they visited CEBU last month. And now I brought my cousins here and we all love it! This resort is a well definition of a paradise! So clean, nice staffs and very nice ambiance! I have been to other 5 star hotels but this place is my most favorite! All the front desk staff are so sweet, the guards are all friendly and the restaurant staffs are all so genuine. Love the food here by the way! And now they have a bakery and a coffee shop! Big thanks to Sir Bryan Gerali for spoiling us. He always made sure that I and the girls will be all pampered. We've got our free massage! And boy, that was our first time and it feels so good. I wonder how many members of the family should I bring here?\\Mikaela E\\The best head and shoulder massage I’ve ever had at the spa. Loyla who gave a wonderful deep pressure massage, I highly recommend.  The facilities where very relaxing and comfortable. Was also served a lemon/cucumber juice and a hot tea afterwards.\\spice787\\I spent 9 wonderful days here, quiet, peaceful and very relaxxxing. Glenn the happy jovial manager could have been the host from Fantasy island as he can make things happen. His entire staff were fantastic and always popping up just when & wherever you needed them and with a big smile. Bakery/coffee shop food and staff = Great !  If things get too quiet, theres lots to do within a 10 min cab ride at other hotels or exploring Newtown shops etc. I enjoyed the private beach and just sitting looking over the infinity pool and watching the world slowly go by and the boats and para sailors. Never actually got around to exploring the other islands but maybe next time. And I didn't need a bank loan to stay here unlike the other surrounding resorts.\\alanr\\The hotel is still in the soft opening phase I believe. Parked in the guest car park which is not yet finished.  Just stayed one night in a premium room with two double beds. Very spacious room with nice bath and shower. Nespresso machine included in the room. Had buffet breakfast which was nice with a reasonable selection and variety of food on offer.  Had lunch and dinner in “The Kitchen”. The service was extremely slow, when ordering we were told the food would take 25 minutes, despite the fact the restaurant was almost empty. Drinks took equally long to arrive. However when the food did arrive it was excellent, very authentic Indonesian and Indian dishes. Hopefully the serving times will improve over time.  We had two massages in “The Spa” , very good with a nice atmosphere.\\Rob B\\I did not know that this resort was undergoing a soft opening upon our visit. We had searched on Agoda and Orbitz and this place kept popping up.  Photos looked good and the rates seemed a good value. We booked 4 days 3 nights here in a standard room. Although Google maps took us off-roading we finally got on track and arrived safely. It's ashame we arrived after dark as you cant truly experience the beauty of the building or exterior architecture at night.  The bell-boys helped us unload our luggage and someone even valet parked our car for us. We went up to the lobby and the Interior Design was stunning.  It made me wonder what the rooms and the rest of the hotel was going to be like. We got checked in right away and up to our room with some cool funky bracelets.   My first"

Bad, slow, inefficient  check in and check out. Service is bad. Dining options are limited, and the food is far from good. The water in the fake saltwater lagoon is dirty and itchy.\\Tour18606261730\\Water facilities/pools are nice. Rooms average. Check in/check out process inefficient and frustrating. Resto staff are not welcoming. More concerned about “audio sound levels of guests” than serving. Breakfast buffet is average.\\Patfancygirl\\The facilities are nice but the service is horrible. The restaurant staff were mot friendly or helpful.   The checkin & checkout process was inefficient, the staff unhelpful, and there were questionable charges. In the end we were billed for someone else’s room because the lady at the checkout counter made a mistake. And they didn’t make any attempt to correct it. We will never stay there again!\\Getaway57327402644\\Grandparents who are elderly had a leak in their room causing brown puddles in the floor or their room and brown water running down the wall. They were transferred to a different room only to have an unbearable smell of paint as they had placed them next to the pool being repainted, so the hotel teansferred them back to the room with brown puddles and they had to stay there for the night. Furthermore, we checking in as a group of 10, only to be told at the arrival of the restaurant on the hotel that we need 2 hours pre order and booking. We were not told this upon check in nor was it in any information leaflets given to us and of course we weren’t willing to wait two hours to eat. In addition, the large pool was closed with the diving rock and the salt water pool was dirty with\\TheLaagan\\This is our second time staying in Plantation Bay. First one was days prior to the wrath of  SuperTyphoon Odette. We're happy to see that the resort has slowly recovered from the damages the Typhoon caused. We are thankful to the staff for granting our request to have our room in the ground floor so it wouldn't be bothersome for my mom who is a senior citizen. The room is clean, spacious, and has the view of the big lagoon. Food is good. They have themed breakfast buffet and it was Chinese themed when we stayed there. So sad that I don't enjoy such food for breakfast. Luckily they have bacon and fruits. I hope they can consider offering a variety of food instead of a themed one. For snacks,  Route 66 offers delicious one. The resort is wide that an overnight stay is not enough\\サーシャ 安\\Water in sea, lagoons, and pools were warm as well as clean. Food was delicious and rooms were cleaned nicely. However, one employee really made our vacation bad. His name is Danny, and he wasn't nice to us. He refused to help, and said that we should solve the problem we had, by ourselves. Happily, other employee helped us soon. However, story with him didn't end. Afterwards, when we met him, he ignored us, and looked away when we greeted. That's why, we didn't enjoy our vacation as we wanted. In addition, at breakfast, variety of food was small compared to other hotels, and it wasn't worth the price we paid for it. It would've been great if there were more salads and food with meat or fish. That is what we felt.  Having said that, we had great time swimming and relaxing in\\Gracemon\\I never expected to have so much fun in an overnight stay. I usually tend to the kids and just relax in the room. This time I was fully outdoor and had as much time enjoying the facilities as everyone. The salt water pool was my fave! We will surely save up for another staycation at this resort.\\Joe M\\This was our 6th time staying at Plantation Bay. My wife and I even got married here in 2008. We love this resort but sadly we were disappointed with the lack of dining options this time.   On some nights there was only one restaurant open for fine dining and one restaurant for casual dining. Two restaurants for the size of that resort is inadequate.  And because our group was more than 4 people, the two fine dining restaurants require you to pay in advance for your food if you want to reserve a table. This policy is terribly inconvenient and unnecessary. You have to walk over to the restaurant hours before and order your food in advance and pay for it and then return hours later to eat it. I have traveled the world with my family and I never heard of this practice anywhere.  We\\Robert I\\Superior resort esp. for families: largest pools I have ever seen, most shallow enough for kids,  rooms in close proximity to the pools, the restaurants are excellent. Palermo offers authentic Italian cuisine; that place knows what it is doing.   I have stayed at Shangrila and Jpark but Plantation Bay offers more for the family at a slightly lower price.\\philipemail425\\We had a very late check in because our flight arrived at 1 AM and after Immigration and Customs, we finally got in the hotel at 3 AM. Unfortunately our room wasn’t ready eventhough it was already paid for. Fortunately the staff were very prompt in fixing the problem and management was also got involved and offered a resolution of the issue. Overall, our stay was very good. The staff were very attentive, the facilities were clean. We would definitely come back to stay here. We enjoyed our stay here and looking forward to come back. Thank you to all the staff who took care of us!\\Dennis P\\I have read a lot of bad reviews about this resort. I didn't expect to have firsthand bad experience. We were forced to booked another extra room just because my extra  4 and 6 years old kids were not free to stay. First time it happened to us. We've been many times to local resorts like shangrila, crimson, dusit and crimson but kids under 6 are free to stay.  All are very considerate and accomodating. Except them and there is something wrong here. This resort is not for family with small kids under 6 yrs old. I will rate our stay a 2⭐ for this. This is My opinion and based also from our experiences from the other resorts.\\Kirstin M\\Had stayed here multiple times because of the clean and  serene place but my most recent stay was not up to par. As always, staff were amazing and the lagoons are stunning. However, the room we had this time wasn't that clean. The floor is dirty (see photos), the first time I entered this room I walked barefoot just to not to leave dirt from my shoes but was surprised that the floor was dusty, it left the soles of my feet black. There were stains on the room and bathroom floor that could be wiped off with a damp cloth. This made me question about the cleanliness in the other parts of the room. :(  Weekend was very crowded with lots of unruly guests not minding social distancing, also don't know how they all fit in one room - that's what we get for a cheap rate I guess. Food in\\Micah C\\Amenities were in decent condition. Food was good. The best part was the staff. Staff are very friendly, accommodating, and patient. They are well trained and very polite. While there may have been a PR flunk recently, it has nothing to do with individuals who pour out their best efforts into creating a wonderful experience for their guests.\\Ram_B1969\\Our most recent stay was for 2 nights, 30th and 31st of December, meaning we had our New Year’s Eve at the resort. It’s one place that I assumed I could trust a New Year’s Eve with, and I wasn’t disappointed. We got the one-bedroom suite. We are a family of 3 adults. I think it was a perfect choice for this stay. Spacious room, really spacious bathroom, with tub, the room was just perfect. My online booking was also smooth, and checking in and out was smoother. We were granted early check-in and late checkout. We felt the same familiar Plantation Bay hospitality as how we experienced it before. Since the place was really big and wide with numerous choices and options for chilling or swimming, physical distancing with other people was easy. Biking around was fun. Looking at our\\Kakah Y\\The only reason why I would come back is because I feel bad for the staff who are cebuanos and are just really coming to work despite pandemic to make ends meet.   1. They told us we can get a room and pay extra person but on our way, they took it back and said we need to get another room for my nannies, which was fine bec I didnt come to beg and I can book them room. I just find this a deceitful act.  2. Two rooms booked, a long list of mostly DONTs yet they cant give us a decent room with an AC that’s working. They had to transfer us because it was busted.  3. TV was also broken! Haha what else can go wrong in this 5-star with so many rules yet failed to meet every expectation.  4. The worst- set breakfast was horrible. Sinangag station is waaaay better than you pay for 480\\Tikya V\\Don’t try to visit this place if your a filipino, because employees here are racist. They love to serve the Korean more than their own Kind. Very unhelpful. There are more beautiful places to stay in Cebu but Not here. Train your staff again of good manner and right conduct! Waste of time and money.\\Ginalyn G\\Place is beautiful but there’s employees who argued and have heated arguments around guests. Hardly anyone even smile. One even had sarcastic tone when asked about service schedule available. We got scolded by an employee for giggling during a funny incident while taking pictures.  We couldn’t wait to get out of there. Actually checked out a day earlier.\\E P\\Their lagoons has poor maintenance, the water is dirty, when I took a bath at one of their ""Lagoons"" my skin was irritated and became very itchy, the reason why I tried this place out was because it was expensive and I was expecting a 5 star experience out of my money but this place is really just ""main stream"" and nothing special out of it, you can find cheaper deals with better experience.\\Chekm8te\\Welp, I normally don't write reviews because I hop around a lot and don't have time to actually write a review.  These days, I'm not hopping around and experiencing a lot of places so I figured I'd write this review and it has been a while since I wrote one.  I've frequented this place since I started coming to Cebu for over a decade now.  I'd say I go almost once a year because I love their unique pools and atmosphere.  There were times (before the pandemic) that this place was booked for weeks and I couldn't get in.  Hated it but with things going on (2020), they are not as backlogged.  We decided to take the little one out to enjoy a pool away from home and I'm glad to see not much has changed.  A few upgrades that I've noticed actually that are pluses like the upgraded\\H Travels\\Every time I visit Cebu my local friends would always tell me to try staying at this resorts - so finally after years of always patronizing the same 5 star international hotel chain in the same island we wanted to give back and support the local businesses. Stating as a 5 star resort one would expect a minimum standard experience especially with its unique lagoon and amenities.   Overall the place still has some elements that held remnants of a great resort in the past but it’s now dilapidated old and just tired; like really tired - it’s definitely seen better days.\\Kurin Williams\\Very unbecoming of a resort. Rude and unfriendly staff. Resort staff kept on following us everywhere and we felt like we were being watched all the time.  This is the last time we're staying there. Book somewhere else and save yourself the headache.\\Mai P\\It could’ve been the perfect getaway for Fin, my child with special needs. When something excites him or when he is happy, he makes it known by squealing with delight. Fin is happy! That is what I always tell him every time he does that.  I thought that was okay until we were told from afar (a lifeguard). As a mother, your initial action would be directed to your child. So I told him not to squeal because it wasn’t allowed. Quite frankly it was a difficult moment. Another lifeguard came and told us the same thing. I had to explain that he is a child with needs. Every time Fin jumps in the water he’d be so happy that he’d laugh and squeals again. I tried hushing him and at one point tried to cover his mouth. But then I realized this is so wrong? This isn’t right at all! The plan\\Xxx\\Staff will approach you right away in the middle of your mobile call. You will surely feel deprived especially it was not written on the entrance or noted on tables or upon check in. No fun noise allowed.\\Michelle SC\\It was a great stay with you, Plantation Bay. As always, great staff and good food! My son and the entire family really enjoyed our stay with you. Although the air-conditioning in our room was not working well, you really fixed it that day (even it took you until night time). You even provided kits like alcohol, mask and gloves. Overall, it was nice and relaxing stay!\\MA R Fernandez\\We stayed here during our quarantine stay when we went home to the Philippines. We didn’t feel like we were quarantined at all because of the calm and peaceful environment of the place. It was a stress-free stay because the staff took care of all our needs, as well as the coordination with the appropriate agencies regarding our swab test results and airline concerns. Kudos to the General Manager, Mr Efren Belarmino, for a job well done!\\Carmen S. Araneta\\Because of the Covid pandemic, my flight from San Francisco to Manila was cancelled 4 times. Finally Philippine Airlines advised my July 3 flight was moved to July 4 & redirected to Cebu Province instead of Manila. Testing for Covid & hotel Quarantine would be in Lapu Lapu City, Cebu Province. At first I was hesitant due to the rise of Covid infections in Cebu City. I was scared but decided to push through. Having had 4 previous cancellations, my return flight was long overdue.   God be praised! My odyssey went very well. San Francisco Airport was eerily empty except for PAL counters. I landed safely at 4:30AM July 6 in Mactan Airport, Lapu Lapu City. Deplaned at 4:40 & was done with all - immigration & Covid testing by 5:10 a record 30 minutes! Mactan Airport had their systems\\Ronnel C\\We having a tour here, it was very comfortable. Swimming pools are wide and boat activity is cheap and fun. Restaurant good but no problem. I'm planing to stay this hotel soon to experience the activities.\\Roel\\Plantation Bay is one of our favorite short getaways! The lagoon right outside the room makes quite a difference in the experience so the ""Lagoon Side"" upgrade was well worth it! We loved going outside the room and immediately having access to the beautiful lagoon! At night, the live jazz music resonated around the resort. The staff were amazing and the food was great! Will definitely stay again!\\Glicel Ann P\\The amenities, activities and wide variety of swimming locations was superb! The Dive rock was a hit for my family. The staff were very pleasant, helpful and catered to our needs extremely well. The activity crew members were very very helpful during the snorkeling excursion and very nice to have all their hands on deck with snorkeling assistance, food and making sure we had a great time!\\SJH2702\\I have stayed at a number of resorts in Cebu but this is the best I have stayed at.  Approx 30-45 mins by car from the airport (depending on time of day & traffic) the facilities here are excellent & offer a great variety regardless of age.  There are a range of restaurants which offer good value for money, multiple swimming pools, plus beach & water activities to choose from.  The staff were excellent - special mention to Kathleen @ Kilimanjaro Kafé, Pia @ Palermo & Dan(iel) @ Swim-up Pool Bar - he is very entertaining.  On the subject of restaurants - I thoroughly enjoyed all the restaurants & the Themed Dinner was an experience of great food plus entertainment by the very talented staff."

The dood was excellent and decently priced. One of the best hotels in Mactan, Philippines.  Only 3 km from airport.  Much better stay than Waterfront.  I will be back.\\Marie G\\We had an amazing experience at this hotel. Everything was perfect and the staff made us feel welcomed and at home. Ralph and Rogel and Marco from housekeeping were incredibly helpful and thorough in keeping our room in pristine condition. Honey and Jessie from the restaurant provided exemplary service and the chefs prepared delicious meals every day. The beautiful beach is a huge bonus!😍 We are so impressed with the quality of this hotel and will definitely be coming back!\\Leon M\\Had a really good time. The rooms are perfect and the pool area is real nice. Had a really great time at the bar with Michael, nice barkeeper who knows his stuff. Always worth a visit. We‘ll come back here!\\Trip27014832240\\My flight today was cancelled, but Philippine Airlines provided a free breakfast and free hotel stay. I am glad that Belmont Hotel staffs are very accommodating especially Ella who turned the situation into satisfying experience. She deserved a raise. I will consider this hotel in the future.  Thank you Ella for your warmth welcome.\\Anne N\\The hotel is very clean, the bed is super comfy.  The staff are amazing, very warm and always happy to help. Sir John at the bar and the buffet area is attentive and always makes sure the guests are enjoying their meals. Love the breakfast buffet!  Will definitely come back and stay in Belmont Hotel when I’m in Cebu. Thank you so much!\\Travel54655918617\\방이 생각보다 편안하고 쾌적해요. 에어컨도 빵빵하고 깨끗합니다. 조식도 맛있어요 후라이 있는 곳에 오믈렛 요청하면 만들어주십니다 직원 john이 사진도 찍어주시고 매우 친절했습니다 덕분에 즐겁게 머물다 갑니다  The room is more comfortable and comfortable than I thought. The air conditioner is good. room is clean. Breakfast is good, too If you ask for an omelet, they'll make it for you Staff John took a picture of me and he was very kind Thanks to you, I enjoyed my stay\\Lito O\\First time to stay at Belmont Hotel-Mactan. Everyone was pleasant from dining staff to housekeeping. What stood out for me was Tina (dining area), her customer service was exceptional. We had a casual conversation after our breakfast and I mentioned that I was looking for “danggit” since it was not available then.  The next day, she approached me and remembered my cravings for “danggit” then she offered and requested their kitchen staff to cook “danggit” for me. Tina made the whole Belmont experience better for me.\\Linsay C\\The rooms were really nice, especially the bed that gives you the most comfort feeling that you could get. The food was right on spot regarding with the taste. We commended their high quality Service both in accomodation and food.\\jenny ann a\\One of the best hotel for a friends staycation night. It’s very peaceful and the hotel staff are very accommodating. We’d also like to thank Ella for making our breakfast extra special.

We stayed at ron 1010 the view was perfect. Cable tv was complete though there were slight glitches with the wifi access to the device. Swimming pol service is awesome. Staff was at the ready with towels on all tables. Overall the best part was ghe staff. Amenities were tops but I would say staff such as Ella Jagonase was very helpful. I'd say this is the best hotel by far in Cebu.\\Albert Chan Paran\\When I got home yesterday after checking out and before I go to bed, it made me feel sad, and need some more time to adjust back to my regular-usual routine fresh from my Belmont Hotel Mactan New Year Birthday 2023 staycation mode after 5 days and 4 nights. I missed the luxurious experience of a brand-new hotel room only a Megaworld Hotels & Resorts newly soft-opened property can deliver.   The all-new amenities give me the kind of comfort, luxury, and relaxation where I instantly feel at home and that includes the supremely soft, large pillows and comforter around me in a cold chilly room on a most comfortable queen-size mattress. The housekeeping attendants always changed and replaced the bedding every single morning which made me feel very special and wonderfully taken care\\Christine Mae A\\We had a great time in Belmont. The service was fantastic, especially the bar staff Michael. He was so friendly and had done extra mile to ensure we are well looked after. He was also very attentive and efficient. He also keep the smile on his face. Will definitely return for next holiday.\\Clare Maxine L\\All the staff are very kind and accommodating.

Soak up the carefree ambiance was amazed at the function room the setup of the table and the food they serve is delicious and most of all the people who assist Mr. Falcon and Mr. Cris were always attentive to the needs of our participants of the event. And the experience limitless comfort and elegance in the rooms where each detail is prepared delicately at the new hotel. The new concept of the rooms which have a special architectural design, thanks to room attendant Ms. Paola who patiently clean our room and prepared always our coffee amenities. Kudos also to the Managers down to the supervisor they always smiled and greeted you by heart when they meet you in hallways or\\Maurice L\\On our first time here, he was very accomodating and he answered all our questions and attended to our concerns. it made our dining experience pleasant. I would definitely come back here again. Although there were some minor issues about the membership discount and the vouchers, He was patient enough to answer all of the question. his name is michael. has a tattoo on his left forearm\\Bambi B\\The Bed and Pillows are very Comfortable, The room generally is Superb quiet, clean and modern, The staff is very accomodated, The Hotel is Perfect and New. I have staying this hotel 3x already. I will give 5 stars on this Hotel with a reasonable price, 100 % satisfaction\\Joanna Faye D\\The hotel situated not very close to the airport,But we really had a wonderful stay in the Hotel.Rooms was clean staffs were hospitable from security to front desk,Nothing incredible in thier breakfast buffet because we dont eat pork products but surprisingly they offered us specially made food , bangus and omelette.big thanks to Jese who took care of us all the way.Shukran\\Abegail A\\Belmont is probably an underrated hotel. It has the best amenities and the rooms are cozy you’d feel like ‘home away from home’. Perhaps the best compliment I would give is the courtesy of the staff. Surely a value we Filipinos are known for around the world. I wish I had stayed there longer. Truly a gem in Cebu!\\Tourist45469782329\\Excellent service and accomodations all around, from its amenities to their very friendly and helpful staff. Our one day stay was due to our flight being delayed, but it truly was an amazing and an exceptionally wonderful experience. Our high commendation also goes to our server, Michael Romero, which was the one-in charge of the closing service on their world-class Restaurant. Kudos to you, sir for entertaining us on our lovely dinner! Overall, 5+ stars! Worth the stay!\\Joems Vareyrow\\💯✅Car Service 💯✅From Guard, Front Office to Concierge this staff are very welcoming.  💯✅Room is spacious and good ambiance  💯✅Food from breakfast to lunch is very good and Ella and whole staff is very approachable to the guest.\\jeorge c\\We were well assisted by Sir Ivan from FO. He really did a great job on managing our expectations plus stay in the facility was very comfortable.  I salute these kind of employees as I, for one,  had also been a frontliner of the airport.

The pool aren’t too hygienic guest doesn’t take shower before go to swim (must put a sign to take a shower first before swimming) The receptionist gave a wrong room key card during check-in and we are super tired from our long trip and can’t wait to rest. 8 out of 10. We are still super happy then.\\Fearless00427750912\\I travelled widely for business when I was working in Apple Computer for more than a decade, staying in 5- & 6- star hotels.  When I walked into Raddision on Tues 5 Sept I felt very good with the elegant and tasteful  interior design. Even the Filipino Ikebana stle flower arrangements everywhere.  I was particularly impressed with the restaurant super service-oriented attention and courtesy.  Paricularky how you trained tour restaurant service staff to be sooo good.  I dropped my breakfast even though out of 4 days I enjoyed 1 day of breakfast as I was very busy with business and leisuure easure eg whale sharks and waterfalls.  Half way my breakfast I wanted to give very good reviews & hence this very long reviews.   If I put excellent '5' peoe tend to think they are so good\\Otis_Jan\\Nothing else to say but amazing place to stay, hospitality is top notch and the service beyond expectation. The staffs were amazing, and the hotel is gorgeous. Loving the live music entertainment in the evening in the bar too, that was a bonus.\\I❤️banff\\We stayed here for 4D/3N. The king bed was gigantic and very comfortable. The room was very clean. I personally picked this hotel for 2 main reason: 1. SM city is just next to the hotel. 2. I don’t want to ride a cab to take us shopping . Very accessible indeed to buy all your pasalubongs. We stayed here after our 3 1/2 week’s vacation mostly within the Visayas Islands.   We wanted to be well rested before our international flight.  We enjoyed our complimentary drinks while listening to the live music playing in the lobby/bar. Night swimming was also fun with our youngest.  Perfect to end the night. We heard the breakfast buffet was the best but we opt out coz we prefer to sleep in. We made reservations for dinner buffet instead and we were not disappointed, well except for the\\dmills332\\Central location for me, as I go to the office and other locations in Cebu and Mactan. I find having SM Mall next door super handy. The staff are always on hand to help out with requests, finding transpo etc.\\Anthony Huang\\Breakfast was delicious many choices but no mangoes in the fruit section.Theresa receptionist is attentive, entertaining and knowledgeable.She is a huge asset to your restaurant. We will definitely be back soon.   A fantastic experience and highly recommended.\\Johntxspud\\Hotel location was great. The location of the room given was next to the elevator foyer where we heard the constant elevator bells and people chatting. Some event had some heavy base that vibrated all the way up to the 14th floor from 8 pm to 6 am.\\JoeyBoyCalifornia\\This hotel sets the standards for all other hotels to aim for.  Clean, safe and have staff that are simply amazing.  Every encounter was pleasant and professional. The staff truly WANT to help their guests.  This is one of the best aspects of the Radisson Blu.  The staff want the guests to be comfortable and to have a pleasant stay; They will literally bend over backwards to make it the best experience.\\iowaloves2travel\\A very nice hotel. The room had a nice desk and they were able to get me an adaptor for my usa laptop. The restaurant had many options for both breakfast and lunch. The bed was firm and the pillows were soft. My room had a walk in shower. The room was musty smelling would be the only downside. The hotel is right next to the mall very easy to walk across the street.\\Ann Carmel M\\Stayed and dined and is always a wonderful experience. Kudos to all the staff and special mention to Therese Pauline for really making sure that we will have the best stay and experience in Radisson Blu.\\Lizbeth\\I had a wonderful experience in Radisson Blu Hotel.

The hotel is conveniently located being next door to the shopping mall, is super clean and exceptional service at all levels. The food was fantastic, with even small touches like vegemite on offer for the Aussie guests. Well done!\\Compass56053400368\\The front desk and restaurant staff are great and friendly. Supposed to have an amazing stay BUT when we checked out the concierge did not assist in opening the door to the exit seeing that I had heavy bags in both hands.\\stevewestcliff\\Great stay and marvellous hotel. Great staff and nice pool. The only issue were the bed sheets were a little itchy but maybe over starched as they were so clean. The pool was lovely and the room attendant amazing. The check in staff brilliant.\\Densyorn27\\The experience that my family had in staying at the Radisson Blu hotel was phenomenal. The facility is clean and top notched and the staff is was beyond exceptional. In my opinion, you get the best value at the best location in Cebu City.

You guys are awesome, thank you so much for this wonderful experience, we will come back there for sure.\\gce909\\Excellent hotel with great breakfast and diner buffet.

Bartenders are so approachable in very  good way they offer good drinks . Place are very nice to hung out highly recommeded .. we are enjoy while staying here.\\18_NorthStar_94\\There’s few things: 1.) Upon booking, they charge local tax and estimated tax after you placed the credit details for booking confirmation  2.) Upon checkin, they let you wait 45mins in the queue 3.) WHEN ITS YOUR TURN, they will tell yoy, there’s no room available  4.) They then let you wait 1hr and 45 mins for yoy to go in. 5.) Pillows were bad.\\Passport39226059828\\Walking through the lobby I was immediately impressed. The service at the front desk was very professional and the room i was given was very comfortable. The food at the buffet everyday was always excellent.\\KritzR3\\Recommendations:  Provide ‘do not disturb’ door knob hanger for guests privacy concerns. Additional daily unique dish for breakfast buffet, with consideration for guest with multiple night stay at the hotel.\\malianfa\\I love my short stay in your hotel and I enjoyed your amazing service. Your personnel are courteous and hospitable. The rate of your hotel is affordable and your ammenities are excellent. Your facilities are well maintained by your hardwoking staff.\\Mirasol M\\Grace Salazar highly recommended us to stay at Radisson Blu. The service was excellent, Girlie took control of our booking and accommodated all our needs in our room. And then Alexine at the buffet treated us like royalty where she surprised us with fruit and a cake in honor of celebrating my husband’s retirement! I highly recommend Radisson to anyone that is staying or visiting Cebu Philippines. Amenities and customer service was outstanding!\\larryhockaday1984\\Customer service was amazing. I stayed for 3 weeks and had no problems. The mall was across the street. Security was friendly and I felt safe. The pool bar employees remember my orders and engaged in small talk.\\michael m\\I cannot praise Radisson Hotel enough for their remarkable dining experience. The food options were diverse, and each dish was crafted with precision and creativity. The flavors were exquisite, and the presentation was a feast for the eyes. The hotel's commitment to exceptional service was epitomized by Kyle, whose attentiveness and friendly demeanor left a lasting impression. Not only that but also Fhel, Jean (reception) for her genuine passion for hospitality and dedication to ensuring guests' satisfaction added an extra layer of enjoyment to my dining experience"

Razel은 언제나 반갑게 우리를 맞이해주었습니다. 두 분 덕분에 즐겁게 하루를 시작할 수 있었습니다. Mr.Nathan과  Ms.Razel에게 다시한번 감사인사를 전하고 싶습니다. The staff are friendly and the location is really great. You can go anywhere close to Cebu it city. Stayed for 3 weeks during my children's summer vacation. While we were here, Mr.Nathan at the reception kindly took care of us. During our stay, he kindly guided us through what we needed. And in the breakfast room Ms. Razel was always happy to welcome us.

The employees, notably Sir Nathan at the front desk and Miss Wengi at Straight Up Bar, are incredibly friendly and helpful. I adore how everyone in Seda would greet us with warm smile. Booked two rooms and I must say each room is very clean but the lighting in Room 1614 was kind of dim, hopefully they will install more lights in this room soon. The pool was also very nice and the staff would really ensure the guests' safety and comfort. Without a doubt, I'll return soon!\\Jonathan L\\We stayed here for a few days with family while visiting from America. We had such a great stay that we went back a couple weeks later when my husband and son joined us. The hotel is very clean and modern. We stayed in the 3 bedroom family suite, which felt like a fully furnished apartment. The best part was the staff, particularly Kingswell, Razel and Rose from Miso restaurant, Loren and Kyla from front desk, and McCoy from housekeeping. Everyone was nice though! The location in IT Park is perfect. We look forward to our next visit!\\Mark Benedict\\Seda is a really good hotel that is contemporary and equipped with all the amenities required, so we were quite happy with our stay there with my friends.

All thanks to Ms. Loren Dignos and her outstanding team. She made sure that my mom's room and our room are right next to each other so Lola can spend more time with the kids. The Filipino breakfast option was nothing but delightful and enjoyed the most by everyone especially my kids. My daughter loved the rice and dried fish and my son loved the puto and sikwate. It was such a treat for them after not having it for almost 4years. The pool was the other highlight that my kids enjoyed the most. Pool was well maintained, and fresh towels were readily available.

It was very classy yet it felt as if you're still at the comfort of your own home. The server, Mr. Kingswell was very friendly and professional. He accommodated us very well.\\Karen C\\I booked a studio room and the first thing I noticed was the musty smell. I called the front desk and they said they will get me an air purifier- never happened. I got so sick the next day, my room was not cleaned, no air purifier- j could not get out of bed. My symptoms improved when I left- it was the worst stay ever . Room 1402- you guys should clean the air filter- it was a horrible experience and I complained, no one came forward to follow up or check on me. I was in disbelief. It was an absolute nightmare!\\Umay Ş\\Rooms are very clean and when you need anything they will provide it 24/7. Everyone speaks English and is eager to make your stay more comfortable. It was my first time in the Philippines and I loved it, would stay here again.\\Melissa R\\We stayed here multiple times during our 2.5 weeks trip and the service was extraordinary. Throughout our trip we also would stay at a few different resorts and Seda’s service was incomparable. Kingswell was a great waiter especially during breakfast.\\Elizabeth V\\Last month, my family and I had the opportunity to spend our weekend at the Seda Hotel Ayala Central Bloc IT Park Lahug Cebu City. The hotel is right beside Ayala Mall . The hotel was the perfect setting for a relaxing getaway. The surroundings were stunning, and we enjoyed our time at the hotel.  Swimming pool, Gym and bar at the roof top.  From the moment we entered the hotel lobby, we were impressed. The interior decor was luxurious yet warm and inviting. The One Bedroom Residence room that we booked was spacious and clean with comfortable  bed and linen. There is a kettle, fridge, iron, washer and dryer and a 2 large TV which we loved. The bathroom was nice with hair blower and bathroom scale.   On the whole, we enjoyed the hospitality at Seda Hotel and we had a wonderful\\Mackenzie Y\\Great breakfast and service, Kingswell is the best server!

I love the moments we shared while we’re taking our breakfast here in Seda hotel. I am very satisfied ❤️❤️❤️\\michaelciel\\Currently 2 weeks into a 5 week stay and as on our previous visit we are thoroughly impressed.  The two bedroom fully serviced apartment is modern and well appointed. Comfy bed and living areas along with two large bathrooms and laundry.  Centrally located in IT Park with supermarket, shopping mall and endless restaurants, cafes and fast food outlets on your doorstep.  Hotel Restaurants are very good and reasonably priced. Food is delicious, very well prepared with endless variety. Outside dining offered on the rooftop along with pool and gym.  The service is second to none in Cebu and is world class. After all a hotel no matter how well presented is nothing without warm, welcoming , friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Also when you are on a long stay in a hotel it is a big test\\alwaystravelsf\\Not a High End Luxury hotel but almost there!  The positive is it’s very clean, quality of finishes very polished and staff excellent and friendly!  Also the location is great as it’s connected to the Ayala Central Block mall.  Lots of restaurants/bars nearby and also Sugbo Mercado.  Room was great and had the 1 bdr apartment which very affordable.   On the negative side is the on-site restaurant breakfast buffet is not good imo.  Many items had run out and not replaced, food isn’t cooked very well and mostly cold.  Many guests will open the holding container and leave open.  Also egg station specialty is eggs sunny side up but they’re always cold even after they just make them.    Swimming pool adequate but kinda small it’s on roof.  So understandable, gym very small, can hear\\jayford l\\We stayed at Seda IT Park for vacation and I really had fun during our stay. Everything is accessible from malls to food park. Staffs are great and warmth welcoming especially Nathan who assisted us from check-in and check-out. He gave us a very nice IT Park view and a complimentary drink at the bar. Thank you Nathan and to all the friendly staff!

At the bar I met Emil and he doing very good Job and also at the Miso buffet resto, I met Kingswel he entertain really well , friendly and hard working. Over all , all staff is doing great. Also i can see ,The lady manager , she was doing very good job for helping her staff at the Miso Resto.\\Bby L\\the nightly fare is well rewarded with a fantastic experience. this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in anywhere. Everything except the pool deck are wonderful. Unfortunately the tiles used at the pool washroom entrance are very slippery. Why hasn't the hotel removed and replaced them? I slipped, and the guard said, we have already told management about the inappropriate tiles. so, you know about this. Change the tiles. It is not a big job.\\Clair D\\Everything is great and very accessible to malls and park. Me and my colleagues would surely choose it again next time we visit Seda. Thanks to Nathan, for your accommodating and helping us through your services.\\Michiko N\\Stayed with my auntie for two nights in a two bedroom, and our stay was great! the service was awesome! Our room was supposed to come with a washer and dryer but only came with a dryer, so they offered us complimentary laundry service. One of the servers was exceptional and incredible with his service (thanks Kingswell!) and he made our breakfast time super enjoyable! Great food too!! Loved everything about our stay!\\Curious17005830904\\Superb inn. Excellent service the room was big, clean, and had everything we needed. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious; The buffet had a very large selection. I had the opportunity to speak with the telephone operators at night because I was having a bad day. They were extremely accommodating and friendly, and I would like to commend them for their excellent service. I believe their names are Diana, Kyla, and Kiara. The location is excellent! right adjacent to the shopping center and I would recommend this hotel to my friends.  Seda, thank you!\\Godxxx01\\This place is great.  The people are really helpful BUT i find it a bit strange to put 2 trainees just standing the whole day by the entrance to greet the hotel guests.  I find it a bit inhumane. I think their talent be use better by really training them. We got an upgrade with a stunning view of city. Not just a room but a BIG 1-bedroom APARTMENT with a functioning washing machine and separate dryer.   The pool was great on the rooftop but the bar is being built, that was a bummer.  I checked our the roof top bar in the evening.  Nice view and vibes and good offers to choice.  Unfortately, it closed really early at  midnight. Highly recommended in the middle of the new spot in Cebu city, the IT PARK with great going out scene and never sleeps due to the overwhelming presence of\\John Alexander Q\\The building feels very brand new. I got a one-bedroom and it was well laid out. The view from the room was also nice. My room had a kitchenette, dining table, couch, and lots of space.   If you are renting a car with driver or have your own car, the parking area exit is next to the drop-off point, so there is really not much wait for your pick-up.  Breakfast was a let down, it was purely Filipino and nothing great. This needs real menu improvement.  Overall I had a great stay."

The two bedroom fully serviced apartment is modern and well appointed. Comfy bed and living areas along with two large bathrooms and laundry.  Centrally located in IT Park with supermarket, shopping mall and endless restaurants, cafes and fast food outlets on your doorstep.  Hotel Restaurants are very good and reasonably priced. Food is delicious, very well prepared with endless variety. Outside dining offered on the rooftop along with pool and gym.  The service is second to none in Cebu and is world class. After all a hotel no matter how well presented is nothing without warm, welcoming , friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Also when you are on a long stay in a hotel it is a big test\\alwaystravelsf\\Not a High End Luxury hotel but almost there!  The positive is it’s very clean, quality of finishes very polished and staff excellent and friendly!  Also the location is great as it’s connected to the Ayala Central Block mall.  Lots of restaurants/bars nearby and also Sugbo Mercado.  Room was great and had the 1 bdr apartment which very affordable.   On the negative side is the on-site restaurant breakfast buffet is not good imo.  Many items had run out and not replaced, food isn’t cooked very well and mostly cold.  Many guests will open the holding container and leave open.  Also egg station specialty is eggs sunny side up but they’re always cold even after they just make them.    Swimming pool adequate but kinda small it’s on roof.  So understandable, gym very small, can hear\\jayford l\\We stayed at Seda IT Park for vacation and I really had fun during our stay.

Staff is not very engaging and take all the complaints and suggestions for granted, as if they are you used to it hearing the same thing over and over again. The only highlights are location and breakfast.\\Galasheeng S\\We had a great stay in here comfy and cozy. Commend to Ritchell and Frances for assisting us during check in and transfer of room for my mom and sis. And also to Jomalie for attending to us during our breakfast. Thank you everyone.\\CMarie L\\We stayed at Seda Central Bloc for at least a month and experienced the best of the best! Everyone was so helpful and nice. Service with a smile! My sister and myself now know that there is nowhere else best to stay but here.  Their apartment style rooms equipped with washer and dryer was a great perk. Rooms were clean always and food was great!   But what was best of all? The people that worked there.. Razel, Kingswell, Nelson, Charlie, etc (there are  so many other names and please forgive me if I have missed mentioning them as my old age memory has caught on :-) )- —we came to know most of them and their impeccable service. From the Bellman, to their front desk, the housekeeping and to the breakfast team! Thank you! Thank you!! Thank you! For making us feel so at home! A home\\Ellery\\As a person with Autism traveling with a dad with physical disability and a senior mom, I have nothing but praises for this hotel. From the moment we got picked up at the airport on 01/27/23, I knew that we would be in great hands. Both gentlemen refused to let us lift a finger. Upon arrival at the hotel & seeing where it’s located ( in Cebu’s I.T. Park), I felt that the location was bang on. When we arrived, the security welcomed us and a bellman acted in seamless haste making us feel like royalty. We wede guided to the 5th floor where the hotel lobby is actually at. Julie of the Front Desk team and every single person of that team during our entire 6 night/7 day stay were not only professional but also very kind. We were given suite 702, my parents 903, my sister and her\\michaelciel\\Wow what a fantastic hotel, located in IT park.  We stayed for a month in a two bedroom apartment and could not have been happier. The apartment comes with two bathrooms, lounge, dining room and kitchen. Expert daily housekeeping by a friendly and efficient team of attendants.  Daily breakfast buffet is first class with local delicacies along with all the western favourites. Great value lunch and dinner buffets along with al a carte menu and because you are in the heart of the city you have 24 hour restaurants along with fast food that you can venture out for have delivered. Loved the bar on the top floor with nightly entertainment along with tasty food and delicious cocktails and a good wine list.  Direct access to shopping centre and supermarket.  Last but most importantly the\\Mykie Louise P\\Our stay at Seda IT Park was by far the best staycation we ever had. WHY?  The room: Surpassed our expectations. It had everything we needed, specially the kitchen. What we saw live was even better than the pics online. We give it a full-on 10!  The staff: They were truly wonderful! From check-in, to renting the hotel vehicle, to breakfast buffets, to room service, uuuup until we checked out, certified: NO HASSLE! SMOOTHE STAY. We thank Frances Marionne from the front desk, and Rachel from the breakfast buffet, the guy who drove us to the airport, and to the wonderful staff that gave us great service, KUDOS!  Will choose SEDA IT Park again for another great stay in Cebu, thanks!\\Gio A\\Posting this to help in the fight against diseases especially covid-19. Cleanliness/Housekeeping in this hotel is very bad. We feel unsafe when it comes to cleanliness/health and anti-covid19 standards.   Upon checkin: 1.) Toilet bowl lid is very dirty with urine probably from previous guest. We called for a cleaner right away. Questionable anti-covid19 standards!!  2.) Lots of small moths flying inside the room!  During the night: 3.) We noticed blood stains on one of the pillows. Yuck!  And btw, do you really not have hand towel available in the room? Or forgotten again by your questionable housekeeping/cleaning team? Even cheap hotels have one.   Urine, blood, and flying insects are not acceptable. Please help fight against covid-19. Hope you improve.\\Rhon Adam L\\While I was walking on the aisle of the restaurant, a man named Felipe approached me with a pleasing appearance that makes my conscience wants to dine in. I thank Felipe for being an extraordinary attendant to me and satisfy my cravings.\\Enlyy\\Stayed for 3 weeks.  2 weeks in One bedroom apartment. It was big and comfortable. Also in the room, there is washing machine and dryer.  1 week in Deluxe room. Cozy and comfortable.  Buffet is also nice, service is good too. Thank you\\A O\\One, if not THE best, hotel in Cebu we’ve  been to so far. Location is good with easy access to the mall, suite room has good lay out, clean & perfect for family. The swimming pool deck had great view , breakfast buffet was great (lots of choices!)  with good view outside the window.  Staff were professional and attentive to guests. The 3 bedroom suite was so worth it with its amenities and location. We had a great time despite the rainy weather we had that day.\\Louieboytoy\\5 star for me!  Seda never fails! Ive been to Seda Nuvali for several times and Seda Cebu is equally impressive!  Staff are friendly! Amenities ✔️ Location is just walking distance to the malls and my office ✔️ Room is very spacious  What they can improve on is their room wifi as it often disconnects.  But over-all, I will surely be back!\\Jen D\\Had the best stay ever at this hotel. Customer service over all is outstanding.    Everyone has been very pleasant, courteous and always ready to help.  Special shoutout to the F&B team, Rose - manager, Francis - supervisor, and the rest of the staff especially Razel.   They have quite a spread for their breakfast buffet and food is tasty but they can add a little bit of variety every now and then. 😊  Room is very clean and cozy.  You get cleaning service every day of the week.  They're generous with their bottled water service (comes free with your room reservation) unlike some hotels where they scrimp on this service.    I would definitely be back here.  😊\\Inna Marie S\\Seda hotel is one of my favorite staycation hotel to go to in Cebu. Aside from being so accessible, the staff here was so nice & very friendly esp. Nathan who happily assisted me during my check in & Wengie who assisted us during our visit to the straight up bar. Very much appreciated! The food here is also superb & if you want to have a chill night with your friends they have a perfect place for that! I really got to relax after my long week of work, a prefect Staycation indeed! Highly recommend! Thank you Seda & I will definitely be back!\\Angelica\\Highly recommended hotel very accessible, amaze how clean and spacious their room, the staff are very friendly. The foods are delicious i would like to thank wengie for accomodating us in straight up bar. We really enjoyed our stay at seda. Thank you also to nathan for the smooth check in eventhough we are late in our check in time. We will surely back!\\Jelord Godrim\\The room are clean and nice, I really love the view in the pool and also the food and drinks in the bar very good and tasty especially in the buffet . The location was very accessible and would like to give a special thanks to Nathan and Wengie for giving their best accomodation for our stay never been accomadated that way before really love it very friendly. Will be probably book another stay soon.\\SCQ\\I've stayed in many Seda hotels before. They're good but still had minor hiccups. Seda Central Bloc,however, beats them all out in terms of hospitality and efficiency. It may not be the biggest and fanciest among all, but it is the best for me.  Check-in was supposed to be at 2:00PM but since our room was already ready, front desk officer Ritchelle let us have an early check-in at 12:00 noon free of charge. On top of this, she was very warm, friendly, and she even remembered me on my last day. Front desk officer Nathan was also very helpful. I had some minor requests and he  gladly asissted me. Housekeeping was also very efficient. Went out for 2+ hours and when we came back our room was already made up. Lastly, check-out was such a breeze. Props to Loren for this. It was the\\Journey217504\\Washer and dryer need I say more?  It’s perfectly located next to Ayala Mall, Starbucks Reserve is within walking distance.  Gym is decent for a good workout, pool nice both located on the 17th floor with an amazing view of the city!!! Everyone at the hotel eager to always help.\\Royce A\\Great city view. Room size is above average meaning bigger than other deluxe Seda rooms we’ve been to.  Misto resto is with a great view but it can be easily get full and refill takes time especially the bacon.   There is direct access to the Mall which is a good thing however there is not much yet in the Central Block Mall but the basics are there.  It could have been 5 star if not for the front desk who called in the middle of the night 10:30pm. They interrupted our sleep for a mistake.  We were asleep when they called to ask if we’re done with the iron and board which we previously requested but declined because there was no available.  Other than that, it was a great 2N/3D. We’ll comeback when in town.\\mmvelasquez\\Location is great, mall restaurants very safe. Very clean and everyone is very nice. Breakfast buffet is very bad nothing at the right temperature, made to order eggs are just eggs pre made sitting under a heat lamp. When asked for fresh made to order eggs they refused to do so. Pork products not cooked thoroughly or very fresh. One morning bugs in cheese. Needless to say they need better management of breakfast buffet from the kitchen out.\\Clow\\This is actually the second time I’ve stayed in this hotel, and both times the experience was well spent. The room was very clean and spacious. The staff are very friendly. The breakfast buffet was what I was looking forward to the most. Highly recommended and I will definitely visit again."

We booked early, they asked for 50% downpayment (which other resorts don’t require) and still made us wait for more than an hour for our rooms to be available.

I’ll recommend here to my friends! Thankyou so much. I love Cebu. I love Bluewater Resort!//joeCworld//Overpriced resort for what you are getting for. The “private” beach was littered with plastics and garbage in and out of the water. The pool water was murky. The bathroom would always emit a strong sewage smell. It’s a happening resort , so it’s always loud and noisy. Definitely not a place to stay if you want that beach peace & quiet time.We booked 5 nights but left after our 4th night (they did not refund that last night btw).  Although, I would commend the staff running the Allegro dining and the front desk. They were professional and very friendly. I paid for both service and the stay as well, not just the service. Reiterating that this was not a cheap hotel. We paid $1,200+ for the  5 nights and that only includes breakfast. Food in the resort is overpriced as well.

There were a lot of meetings beforehand to make sure that everything is ironed out. Logistic-wise, here's our experience: - Group check-in was late. The last group was checked-in at almost 5 pm. We had an early morning flight so this caused discomfort for most participants. We have an event at dinner time so people had no time to rest. - Food was hit or miss.//Hertz A//One thing that I always check every time I go to a spa is cleanliness. Let me tell you, theirs is superb. And nothing beats the smell of a clean sheet while you lie and relax. Definitely the best massage and sauna experience by far!//Sonia C//Staffs are very friendly and entertaining guest very well. Food are good. Different kind of tea bag is great. Any problems/concerns resolved right away. We love landscape, restaurant and beaches are very convenient. It's great and wonderful. I recommend this BLUEWATER RESORT to all tourists come in Philippines. Thank you.//abe a//Ambience: Not as restful and relaxing as expected. The rooms are big but not insulated? I keep waking up to the sound of people at the pool outside and the resort staff chatting by the lifeguard station. At night when the pool is quiet, i wake up to the sound of a cat.  The beach itself isn't ideal for swimming. Seemed like a mangrove area.  There was a LOT of food for our event and for the , but sadly there fell way short of expectation. There was a lot of flies on the night buffet we had at the sandbar. We were there for a weekend and it was the one time they served the famous Cebu lechon but I couldn't even try with all the giant flies.  Service: Our flight was already delayed but when we arrived we sat at the function hall waiting for a room to open up so we could check in.//Dream157783//Since 2010 we are regular guests from Europe and 1 or 2 times a year, 2-3 weeks each, in BLUEWATER MARIBAGO BEACH RESORT. Till 2020, before pandemic, we are as more as more as pleased and felt there always very well. But this year, 2023, it changed completely, we were really disappointed. The breakfast buffet has been changed, some small doesn't longer offered e. g. yoghurt or french toast. But ok, we understand it. Each 2nd day it exists an event at the beach area, often as more as one. On weeksends (Sa to Su) often up to 5 events and it is impossible to enjoy the beach area for the guests. In one night from Fr to Sa you built again one more tent for one more event at the beach and it ends after 3 am. It was noisy and we couldn't fall in a sleep. On the next morning we talked//Lala258//Resort price and staff service were very good! They do first come first serve basis. The only concern was the beach area, rubbish leftover from fathers day guest was left overnight in the beach and was cleaned up in the  following morning by the tide. Spoke to one guard roaming around and his saying they do the cleaning. Somehow i never argue about it. What i have seen hoping will never be seen again by another guest. Anyway i do hope they will improve the cleanliness in the beach area as they have a beautiful beach. Only a bit muddy under the water where its the type of area they are in and thats nothing we can do about that. Enjoyed our time inspite of all that as staff are all accommodating and so friendly.

Shout out to front peeps Cortney and Jay who were professional and very helpful during check-in, although they were busy, but they made sure that our rooms became available since we had a senior citizen with us. Big thank you. And with Ian of restaurant, he's very attentive to our needs. By the way, the food is great!//Ai//Everyone was very kind and accommodating, any concerns were quickly resolved. As a person with severe food allergies they were very thorough in making sure my food was safe for me to eat and made me feel at ease. Food was delicious! The pools are well cleaned, the beach was intimate and serene. 食べ物はおいしかったです、楽しかったです❤️//Robert A//Nice workers all thru, very helpful and courteous.  great food selection at the Buffets.

Many ramps and railings available. many facilities within the resort, tasty food, access to the private beach, child and family friendly.//Peter A//Beautiful place.

I highly recommend this resort/hotel for anyone visiting Cebu.//rossettig//Family event -  From the get go at arrival to departure  front desk service was pitiful and awful experience. Booked two rooms with breakfast and dinner included.  No TV service and no WiFi in room. Was given a run around from front desk multiple times and multiple techs that could not resolve problem. Demand to speak to a managed and was told was on day off. ( Friday check in)- ugh) -  That’s okay I will be here tomorrow as well.  Manager did greet me same day and did change our two rooms. Guess what ? no TV in one room and no WiFi  linked to room number. Run around again. WiFi connection not granted for 24 hours after signing in to visitors WiFi . Ugh again - can’t explain stupid - No pool towels cards given at check in and run around again when needing a pool towel.  Was not//JUNG JUHYUN J//This is my second visit  Last time I was in the premiere room  This time, both of us are satisfied with the Amuma room.

The rooms were fine, nothing outstanding but they were very clean and comfortable. Food was great and the staff were fantastic, very friendly and helpful. The resort is old now and its showing but my stay was enjoyable and I would recommend it.//Youmin K//I took a massage course of “Amuma signature healer” today by Rose. She was awesome I can really being relaxed with this good experience. And I had a cramp in my left leg so also took a massage of “Food massage”. It was also nice because I could take this service in front of the swimming pool with birds singing.

Eggs were tasty, fluffy and not oily by Chef Daneth at the egg station. And the ""donuts"" by SSI Chef Nino were exceptional! In fact I ask them if they sell the donuts so I could buy and bring it home for my son and husband to enjoy.

Very satisfied member here👌.//Discover628530//the  picture of the little island opposite of the bay doesnt resemble ANYTHING on the pictures. we walked across the bay to check it out, only to walk thru the water where there was rusty tin cans and metal bars on the ground. wehen we got to the island the dirty chairs were stacked, no lounges, no bar, no nice flags, no staff, NOTHING!!! On the way back one of us stepped on sea urchins. Got 15 spikes! There was no caution information that we were endangered in any way. The experience was very disappointing, leading to us leaving to go somewhere else to enjoy the ocean. The food, rooms, pools and staff were all fine, pleasant and helpful.//Dennis P//Its my second time visiting this resort. It seems nothing has change since 10yrs ago. And i think its time to do for some upgrades. but still it is beautiful, clean, well maintained, friendly staff and  affordable. Not bad for a 4 star rated resort.//Debbie G//Amuma spa was VERY NICE. Highly recommended!   Rooms were big and spacious!   With 3 pools, we had a lot of options. The beach had white sands and fishes- thoroughly enjoyed by our kids-6yo and 7yo.   Food was very delicious. Breakfast buffet offered international fare with Filipino/Cebuano influence incorporated in pastries. Loved the bibingka- filipino coconut cake.  Service is very exceptional!//Jules B//Great resort with lots of options to relax. Breakfast buffet is superb and should not be missed.  Happy hour at the Oyster Bar is a fantastic place to unwind and get ready for an evening meal. The staff are wonderful and welcoming. Would come back again."

We had good time at Crimson resort. And food was great. Room still nice and clean. We want visit again after all restaurant reopen.\\Alvienne Marie Dominguez\\My husband surprised me with a staycation for my 30th birthday. Upon arrival, we felt the    Warm welcome of the staff. This moment already gave us the impression that we would enjoy our stay.   Our room was clean, spacious, and perfectly situated near the main pool and beach.   We went on with our day and got to meet a lot of their staff who took the time to check in on us and greeted us along the way.   They are really proactive in letting us know what activities they have and other upcoming activities for the day.   We watched their evening ritual and enjoyed night swimming with my sisters.   On the next day, we  had breakfast at Enye and the food was delicious!   After breakfast, we went on to enjoy the pool and got to experience their pool foam party!

They surprised my daughter with a birthday greeting and a cake. We were all shocked and happy at the same time. Our daughter loves Crimzone lots of activities for them to do. Super friendly staff. The food as always is delicious!!! I highly recommend to stay at least 2 nights to fully enjoy every facility and amenities they have. If you are looking for an escape and best staycation experience make it Crimson Resort and Spa. Thank you again for giving our daughter the best birthday bash! Cheers! To more experiences and adventures to come. See you again soon.\\bianca c\\Our experience was perfect. The rooms were incredibly clean, the staff were attentive and friendly. There was impeccable attention to detail in every corner of the resort. We came with children and never felt that they were a bother.\\David B\\Great food,  excellent service,  always a favorite. Rooms are excellent and comfortable and the facilities first class.  Crimson is one of our favorite resorts and we will keep coming back again and again.\\Anton del Prado\\I just came from the resort and their service exceeded my expectations! Service was excellent from top to bottom. It was so personalized that I took note of each person's name and what they did for us.  Herley - We were fortunate enough to be invited by her for their opening promo prior to their grand launch. We booked 2 nights and this is where it all started.   Gel - She welcomed us at the lobby and brought us directly to our room for the check-in transaction. On the way to the room she talked to us about the amenities of the resort.  Jester- She was awesome with her warm, never-ending smile and prompt service. She talked with us every time we bumped into each other. She was always asking us how our stay was and if we needed anything.  Liza - invited us to play life-sized\\Nyree R\\Spend a great weekend with my husband and friends. Staffs are so friendly. They had an honest bell man that returned my white and yellow gold bracelet in their lost and found section. Thank you very much.\\Opsrey a\\We had the best time in Crimson.  Spent the weekend with my family and we couldn’t ask for more.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. We all loved the activities the resort offers - foam party, playtime for kids at crimzone, fish feeding and so much more. Breakfast was superb and food at Enye is amazing. Asado was my favorite.  The thoughtful amenities upon arrival and at night is just impressive.   Highly recommended for families! We will be back for sure.\\Georgia May K\\Crimson resort is now our family's favorite resort.  The staff are very helpful, courteous and very professional. Food is excellent.  The resort is probably one of the most beautiful place if not the best in Cebu.\\Kiana s\\Services and staffs are 100% accomodating and they make sure you have all the needs of your stay and as well as you've enjoyed your stay. This is my first time checking in crimson mactan, Foods are tasty and comfortable to walk around. All of their staffs and crews are well-mannered.\\TheLaagan\\It was indeed a well spent long weekend and a best choice of place to celebrate my birthday. Every staff is always wearing a smile. Special thanks to Ms. Aizel, Ms. Jesster and the rest of the Front Office staff for making sure we enjoy our stay. The birthday cake is so delicious, really didn't expect to have that in our room the moment we checked in. My mom really enjoyed her swimming time from the crimzone pool, infinity pool to the white sand beach. We ate dinner at Kalma. The food is worthy of the price and is served on time. A wide variety of food is also served for breakfast buffet(I preferred their setup over the themed breakfast buffet of another resort in Marigondon). We stayed at a deluxe room which is spacious enough, and has complete basic amenities. The WiFi\\Judy D\\It's my second time staying at Crimson Mactan and as expected warm hospitality welcomes you the moment you arrive.The staff are very generous. Food is great especially the breakfast buffet. Rooms are spacious, comfy and clean. Crystal clear infinity pool and white sand beach. All you need to relax, Crimson has it. Can't wait to be back.\\Thara B.\\We originally had a reservation for January 2022, to celebrate our wedding anniv, but Typhoon Odette happened December 2021.  The resort was badly affected thus they needed to close for renovation.  We were promptly refunded for that.  Then we bought their voucher Feb last year, hoping to visit them when they open again, but had no chance to use it sooner since the renovation really took time (still on the process of renovating other parts of the resort, but no worries, coz the on-going work is not bothersome to guests).  Then, finally we got an email invite from them for their soft opening.  So we grabbed the chance to stay for the long weekend, and we were not disappointed.  Reservation officer Em-Ar was so considerate to accomodate our request to move our reservation (though\\Yancy C\\The rooms are squeaky clean. Spacious. And the resort itself is really breathtaking. The staffs are superb! Especially Aizel and Jesster who granted our requests. Also Norman, Gino & Jojo for helping us out in our requests while staying. And the icing on the cake was the sweet surprise from their staff namely Aimi and Jay my parents were really happy spending another milestone as a wedded couple and we could not be more happier. Will surely recommend Crimson Mactan not only to my family and friends but also to the world!\\נועה מ\\A stunning hotel. Amazingly designed. A pampering pool and a great breakfast. There is an happy hour in the pool bar for the cocktails and they are very tasty. The food we ordered at the pool bar was also excellent. The staff is so nice and helpful in everything we asked for. And especially  cute vincci!! helped us every time we asked and always with a smile, definitely ❤️❤️❤️greatly ,improving our experience\\nechama w\\Such a gorgeous resort with a stunning pool and beach. Everything was clean and the staff were so helpful and friendly. We were looked after in particular by Juvz and I got a massage by Ann which was amazing! Overall highly recommend and can’t wait to visit again. Thank you\\Corazon C\\We booked 7 rooms for an impromptu bday celebration for my tita with Immediate family. It was indeed worth the wait ..after being closed for more than a year. Service was excellent from the moment we stepped inside the resort until the next day when we checked out. The rooms were clean, comfortable with a special mini bar treat. Loved the nespresso  machines in the rooms. Reminded me of the kdrama  King The Land...Dinner  at Enye was also a perfect way to celebrate my tita s bday...all the staff ..from the front desk, maintenance, pool attendants, room attendants, waiters, housekeepers made us feel welcome.Good Job on the re opening of Crimson  Mactan!!!!\\Juno V\\The experience was superb from check-in to checkout. The ambiance was very welcoming and also the staff. We only stayed for a night but the memories it gave us remain forever. The food at Enye was world-class and the room amenities were generous. I was gladly surprised by the Crimson Tote Bag and the hat!\\Capt. Dexter Wong\\We had a wonderful stay at Crimson Resort and Spa Mactan with my family. Ms. Jester, the guest officer and the rest of her team warmly greeted us upon arrival and was exceptionally attentive throughout our three-day stay, constantly checking in on us. Norman, who drives the golf cart ensured the proper transport of our luggage and safely brought us to our room and to the parking area when we left.  Ms. Liza and the rest of the crimzone crew were extremely helpful in entertaining and assisting my kids while they played in the playroom. The Enye crew were also very friendly and provided outstanding service everytime we had our breakfast there.  Overall the entire Crimson staff exceeded  our expectations. They were all exeptional and we would highly recommend Crimson Resort and Spa\\guillente\\The aircon is like an oven.  So hot! The place is not family oriented and they are foreign friendly.  Not suitable for locals.  The service crew especially the ACU repairman was not available.  So, the imconveniences were not addressed right away.\\Ian\\We had a gathering event in a Coral Ballroom. The ambiance and table setting was great, the food was excellent and the teams were polite, friendly and helpful. Special thanks to Mr. Warren & Ms. Candy for accommodating us till the end.\\Wander07389151035\\All I can say is two thumbs up. Service was impeccable, and the resort itself was divine, very aesthetic, immaculate and soooo relaxing. Upon arrival at the resort, the views were amazing, especially in the day.  The rooms were relaxing and clean, and the staff was friendly and reliable  regaedless, when asked for any service. Lots of options for in-resort and  beachfront activities, so you won't be bored. Definitely highly recommended  for any guest local or international, you won't be disappointed!\\Julianne M\\Crimson Mactan went above and beyond to make us feel at home. The staff was warm, courteous, attentive and quick to respond. Breakfast spread was incredible, props to the head chef who made sure everything that comes out of the kitchen is of quality. We chose Crimson as our wedding venue and while it rained during our reception, the whole team was quick to respond to transfer everyone to the ballroom to keep the party going! They were also generous enough to hold a foam pool party for us the day after the wedding. The premises were clean and beautiful, rooms are cozy... we have no regrets with holding the best day of our lives at Crimson Mactan!\\Patrice\\Aside from the access to the infinity pool and the cleanliness of the premises, the service was deplorable and the security staff rather rude and pretentious, especially at the entrance to the resort. We won't be coming here again.\\Luna F\\GOOD - When you head to your room, take a moment to appreciate the garden view. It offers a distinct blend of urban tranquility unlike what you'll find at other resorts in the city. It's a wonderfully beautiful setting that will make your stay even more memorable. - The pool area is stunning and would make a great backdrop for photos. JUST OKAY -The lighting in the room is a bit low, which bothers me but could be pleasant for others.\\Donna Faith A\\My family enjoyed our stay at Crimson. Amenities are superb and world-class. Rooms and entire vicinity are clean. The villa in which we stayed was the best! We had a great experience from check in to departure. Everything was fast, smooth snd organized. Perfect service indeed. Crimson staff is the best!  Everyone we met was friendly and accomodating, ready to serve, answered all queries and met our needs.  Crimson will have a special place in our hearts! Thank you Crimson for everything! God bless! :)\\sue p\\Lovely place to stay, Rooms are clean,  true to authentic filipino style, comfortable and really well designed. The little veranda is a nice place at evenings or early mornings when you get lazy to stroll anywhere else.  the beach while not that long or wide was well kept, white and sandy, against the water so clean and blue.  Staff are absolutely smiling all the way through - such a filipino culture! So accommodating and no request too big!  Pools are well placed and the view is outstanding. Food is forgettable but really it's not bad, it's just not what I got for the price I paid but it was fine.   All in all would certainly go back and defo well and truly worth recommending!\\Rose Anne T\\We were given a voucher from our company to crimson hotel, alabang.  We were surprised with the accomodations, assistance and hospitality of all your staffs. From the lobby, concierge, amenities areas, front desk, guards, as in lahat po. They were all nice and always sending smiles after you asked them a favor.  Special mention to Ms. Karen of Lobby, she did a great job assisting our concerns, orders and everything we ask her. Very accomodating po. Thank you ms. Karen ha.  To sir Ian of front desk, you are the best. You deserve to be on a higher spot. Aside from your good looking, you have a kind heart inside. You gave us considerations and make us feel welcome and comfortable in staying at your hotel, since first time po namin here.  Hindi kami nahirapan over all. We enjoyed!"

I 'll definitely stay at seda again. breakfast was good.  it felt secured each time security guard at the gate checked whenever I entered.\\rmbagsik\\Seda did not disappoint. Location is ideal and accessible to the mall and public transport. Restaurant staff and Front of House team are very helpful and friendly. The cleaning crew is thorough.  Overall - will definitely back once we visit Cebu city again.\\pallegumaraojr\\We arrived past 10pm and our room was still reserved for us. The room was spacious and very cozy. There have been no problems during our stay. We were just there for a night, but we had a good time. The buffet was lovely as well. Can't wait for our nexr stay.\\adal\\Seda Ayala Centre Cebu is ideally located adjacent to the mall. Airport transfer was prompt and comfortable. Despite some online reservation hiccups, check-in was speedy since Gia at Front Desk quickly resolved the problem. Prior email arrangements with Misto Assistant Manager Adonis for lunch and dinner assured my group of a lovely and pleasurable dining experience. Angelica made sure we enjoyed our pasta and pizza buffet lunch which was quite interesting. We also got excellent menu recommendations from Camille who assisted my group of ten at dinner and everyone loved the a la carte dishes as well as her efficiency kind attention to detail. Breakfast buffet had the crispiest bacon, the freshest fruit, and a variety of dishes to relish.  It was a very relaxing and hassle-free\\Cliff C\\The hotel's staff were wearing smile and polite all the time and gave me a lot of support when I needed. the room was clean and cozy, but noise seemed easily transparent from the one next door.   Gym equipment is maintained well, despite they had been used for years.  Besides that, this hotel is really recommended for the food, ambience, staffs, pool and pool side bar, and most importance is the location and even easy access to Ayala mall .\\gerarduy2023\\very good service, satisfied, nice place to stay. airport and hotel transfer very prompt. no waiting time. we will definitely come back next time we visit cebu.  highly recommended.. same as your other affiliate hotels here in Metro Manila\\Stay358177\\Our stay in the hotel was above expectations. The staff and crew were very pleasant and courteous enough to interact with. Rooms and amenities were pretty clean and convenient. Overall, our experience here in Seda Ayala Center Cebu was very good.\\Gregg F\\Stopped in after a week of business travel for some relaxation.  The hotel is located in the heart of Cebu City next to a very nice mall. Firstly, the staff is really nice and helpful here. The ladies at the front desk helped us multiple times with finding places and making dinner reservations. The hotel is older with faded carpet, but is still quite nice and very clean. The best part is the room air conditioning works great and doesn’t turn off in the middle of the night like some other hotels.  When going into the Club Lounge, Mary was always there with a big smile and offered a little chit chat asking how the day went or how dinner was.  As a traveler with elite status at multiple hotel chains, I always appreciate that personal touch like remembering my name and the things I\\Apple T\\Thanks to Christopher Crisologo for arranging a birthday cake. He is very professional in dealing guests needs. Marlo during bfast was very attentive,Nica, Karen at the front desk very efficient. Front desk staffforgot the name who extended our LCO was flexible.\\Jess S\\Stayed here twice on separate occasions during our recent holiday in Cebu. Staff were very friendly throughout the duration of both our stays. Front desk helped organised late check out and airport transfer, both reasonably priced. Location is fantastic, only a  5min walk to Ayala mall and the many restaurant options. Pool was ok, smaller than what we expected. Breakfast buffet was great, lots of options to choose from. Note need to go before 8am to avoid the rush otherwise will need to wait for a table. Beds are comfortable. Rooms are reasonably clean however the bathrooms could use a deep clean, visible mould in the shower, basin, bidet hose, and rusty garbage bin. There is a mini fridge in the rooms however they didn’t get very cold even after trying to adjust the settings.\\theflyingtrainer\\The good. Great location. Right beside a good mall. In the mornings, you can walk/jog around the mall garden. Appetizing breakfast buffet. Friendly staff. Clean rooms.  The bad. Conference room projectors are blurry.\\P.M.\\First and foremost - The staff of Seda - from security to reception to housekeeping to maintenance to the Misto Restaurant have all been exceptional!  Smiles and greetings everyday!  We stayed long term (two weeks) - I normally try to book directly with hotels, but the Seda price was $2,976 (AUD) - so I ended up booking through Agoda for $2,283 (AUD) - a saving of $700 (AUD).  We stayed in room 429 - with a view of the street front of the hotel just over the roof line of the entry.  (Last year in November we stayed for 3 nights on the 6th floor with a view of the Ayala Center Terraces and it was a great view especially since Ayala was decorated for Christmas).  It would have been nice to have a room on the Ayala side since we were staying so long, but probably ended up on the\\janethharvey\\This was our first stay at the Seda brand, although we have stayed at this location when it was a Marriott.  We were quite  impressed with the quality of the rooms, the polite and very attentive staff, food, value, and overall atmosphere of this excellent hotel.  The hotel's proximity to an excellent mall, variety of food offerings, and atmosphere, were all excellent.  We look forward to our return trips.\\Cindy T\\The service is great - efficient staff esp at the buffet room, in particular staff named Ivy and Angeline!  Our room is always nicely made up by our cleaners Rafgi and Julu! Food needs improvement though.    The congee is inconsistent, sometimes watery n sometimes thick.  There need to be a better toaster for breads that couldn't fit on slice bread slots. Attended the Seafood Friday, the service catering on servicing the lobster  was not only slow, it was chaotic such that our individual lobsters got mixed up at our table, some of which we didn't even order!  And the lobsters were not fresh - they were mushy rather than tangy.  Orange juice was too watered down.\\Excursion12625727268\\Really nice hotel. The breakfast and dinner buffets were amazing, especially the seafood buffet on Friday’s. Special mention to Angelica on the day shift in the restaurant. Very friendly and made me feel very welcome.\\ysilk85\\It was so nice as a hotel located next to Ayala Mall, shopping and dining were so convenient, and the hotel breakfast was satisfactory. I was impressed by the fact that the staff were friendly and tried to help.\\HmDePerio\\I have always love seda. Theres no question to it. I know i always get a good sleep at seda. Clean sheets and towels.  The staff were very courteous and friendly. Although some needs to greet and acknowledge the guest at all time. For the past two weeks of my trip i have been to few hotels and greeting a guest on the hallways or anywhere in the establishment is a plus.\\Carsten R\\As always when we travel to the Philippines we stay at Seda Ayala Center Cebu. We stayed in a Junior Suite, which had a small anteroom with a sofa, table, closet and TV. I knew this suite and everything was as expected. When making the reservation I had ordered an extra bed, this was shown on the reservation with a one-time 2,000 peso. In the hotel I should pay this amount then daily, we have then waived it and used the sofa as a sleeping accommodation.  The room cleaning was sometimes very slow, we have made with the employee partly a cleaning appointment, which was then also times not kept. We also had to call after the room cleaning because the soap or toilet paper was not refilled.   We had booked the room with breakfast, the rich breakfast internationally oriented and\\anamhipolito24\\Location is superb. Staff are great. Easy to deal with and guests were well taken care of with simple requests,even there are lots of guests during our  stay.we will consider to stay here again.i just hope the lobby will ne more modern feels  just like here in manila.pls replace the  bathroom towels with new one.i think its too old to use.\\RetiredLEOPCSO\\The location of this hotel makes it great for travelers, who do not want to travel far to find decent food. The DJ near the pool every evening add some ambience. The employees are always kind in engaging with visitors. The breakfast is better than most the hotel is getting Older but it’s still comfortable and clean generally.\\Orly D\\I have been staying at this property for many years now even before it became SEDA. It is a very convenient place being just beside a mall and highly secure, the kind most travelers are looking for in a hotel.\\pattidapitan\\Overall my review is great,  room is always made by Ericson (our attendant) my check in was prompt thru the help of Stephen.  The whole housekeeping team under the supervision of Darvey Demicillo was excellent.  I can't thank everybody enough, it made my stay a very pleasant 3 days.\\rvt1988\\One of the better Seda Hotels. Very clean and comfortable rooms. The couch in our room is soft and the pillows are very soft. Quality and variety of breakfast food is also excellent. Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends.\\Kathy T\\What can I say about Seda Ayala Center Cebu and Seda IT Bloc. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay safe and stress free. We've enjoyed everyone hospitality and the securities made us feel valued. The people in Seda are beautiful and kind. I would recommend anyone to consider staying here. It has all the amenities since the mall is right next door. Thank you, Seda for the warm and amazing stay!\\indiana712023\\The junior is very basic and bland. No iron and bathroom door won’t close. The toiletries provided were too tiny. The closet had no iron and was open with no cover. It did not look like a four star hotel room.  The staff were very courteous and nice!\\F. Scott\\As much as I wanted to give a perfect score, I decided not to because I believe that there’s always a room for improvement.  This used to Marriot hotel and I stayed once before with my husband. I tried to refresh my memory on comparing everything. But i guess, there’s only a couple of things that’s make it different. Anyway, I would like to applaud all the staff for doing their job so well. They are very friendly, accommodating, hospitable, courteous, respectful and very warm. The location of this hotel is very accessible and it’s very safe. The buffet was really good. Overall, this hotel is a great place to stay. Truly, great staff and great service…\\elginleon\\Not the hotels fault but we stayed in the gumamela room for several hours due to availability, but when we were checked in everything was perfect, the staff was friendly and accommodating, keep it up guys!! Y’all are the best!!\\Trex1887\\Our experience in SEDA Ayala Cebu is very good. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. The room is very comfortable and connectivity is fast. The location of the hotel is just right for us to experience Cebu City. The overall experience is very satisfactory."

If you’re vacationing, there is no reason to leave the property with all the activities that are available, from sitting at one of the many pools or the beautiful beach, learning to dive, snorkeling, working out in the health club, feeding the fish in the fish sanctuary, paddleboarding, kayaking, playing putt-putt, golfing (chipping only, not a full course), doing\\Mike G\\Being going here 20 years + enjoying happy he and having dinner and celebrating birthdays and Christmas, New Year plus entertaining friends and business associates. WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT NOW THEY HAVE STOPPED THE HAPPY HR THURSDAY FRIDAY SATURDAY SUNDAY.  Many people disappointed at this bad decision and have moved to other venues. For sure as losing out on food sales.  The staff are still great and will miss my time there alot. Seems like Shangri la greed overtook sense.\\Dave A\\I was dining with my girlfriend at the observatory. We were served by Klerk who did a phenomenal job. The night was special as I proposed to my girlfriend. The food and service were definitely top tier\\엘린 J\\This is my second visit to Shangri-La I learned some languages here and greeted the staff. They were very kind with smiles.  Romnick was particularly kind and touching. The facilities were of course clean and special. We also need to show a kind smile to our staff. I'll come to Shangri-La again. I'm surprised.\\Trek04163980719\\Our stay here was great! The staff is super friendly, especially Alain, Duff and Abby! We really enjoyed their warm spirit and friendliness! The grounds crew did a great job keeping the resort looking clean. Thanks!!!\\금 금\\We have a wonderful time with my family playing mini golf competition lol. Alain guide supervised our game with other family and it was so exciting. The game  was just like combination of golf only putter and billiards. Also he gave us complimentary coupon for two champions. Thank you for the guide and shangri la resort for making that good activity. Hope to come back here.\\shopsbh\\We've been returning to the Mactan Shangri-la for 17 years, and we continue to love it and discover something new each time. We loved staying in the Ocean Wing with a balcony view of the beautiful waters and enjoyed the Club Lounge. We missed the family happy hour by the pool that they used to have, but everything else was just the way we had remembered, from the kids' play areas and swimming pool fun to the fantastic service. We look forward to a future return.\\Aj C\\Amazing dinner at Cowrie Cove tonight. It was my our anniversary so we decided to get a private dinner. They go all out. The chef put together a some of the best seafood and steak dishes we have ever had. Klerk was our waiter and we couldn’t have had a better experience with him. He was attentive but not overbearing. 10/10\\Reixne M\\Shangri-la mactan is by far the best resort i’ve stayed in. It’s just simply a magical paradise. It is so romantic. The staff were so accomodating too from the receptionist to when we stayed in the beach and in the pool. Richie was just soooo accomodating and kind enough to make sure our food and drinks orders are served well. 👌 and the smokey black burger in buko restaurant was fire and by the far the best burger i had. The gin and tonic hits the spot 😜 The breakfast at tides has a wide array of food selection. Our room was great with an amazing view from our veranda. I’ll surely go back with my fiancee and my family and his family 🥰🥰🥰\\Rk E\\The beach is nice the service is good and the food also all the waiters are attentive and very good view very good food. Nice beach and nice swimming pool. I wanna go back to shangrila always. Thankyou!\\Ab C\\The pillows are good. The service is great. There are nice people. I was able to go to the pool and everything was clean and set in tone. The food in Tides was so delicious. The beach is so nice. Keep up the good work!\\창준 조\\I felt good bcz  belmart bartender of cowrie cove  He was very kind and good manners  I want be here again  Thanks to him good luck so i was very happy  I had good memory and picture 한국에서 경험하기 힘든 좋은 경험이었습니다.  코리코브 바텐더 벨마트의 매너에 감동했습니다. 우리 가족에게 좋은 추억을 남겨줘서 감사합니다.\\Challaine\\Loved the views from our hotel room! People were very welcoming and hospitable, especially Alvin who took good care of us at the buffet. I celebrated my 21st here with good memories and no regrets!!!!\\AJ B\\Great views from hotel balcony and private beach… EXCELLENT service from May and especially Alvin. Despite the pressure and loads of customers during the morning buffet breakfast, Alvin made sure to serve each one of us properly with great personality! May properly served my family and I during my sister’s 21st birthday for our dinner buffet and made sure that we get the quality experience. Will definitely come back here again and am really hoping to see Alvin, May and other employees again!\\Quest01662934255\\The places in the hotel are very well managed and user friendly. The workers, the security, the waiters and waitresses are all very polite, helpful and nice. It is the first time I meet this highly trained people in other hotels. The waitresses in Acqua are excellent, Jovy and Maria are excellent and commendable!\\Nel\\1.  I left my jacket(my fault) on the chair at the balcony and reported it couple of hours after I checked out (phone call and email) but was told that it's not there and not in the lost and found dept as well.  I am very sure it's there as it rained a day before and I have to hung it there as it got wet.    2.  The girl serving the welcome drink bypassed us. She offered welcome drinks to the guest infront and behind us but not to us (even though we arrived first).  She prioritizes foreign guests over locals which is so discriminating.  My kids we're waiting for their turn to be offered a drink but this girl didn't bother because she was so busy looking for foreign-looking guests.  This kind of person should't be on the frontline.\\Ian Chan\\Amazing experience and hospitality by Shangri-La Mactan. Thanks to Val ate and her team of the hardest working staff I've seen on any hospitality business. Will definitely come back in the future!  Maraming Salamat pamilya sa Pilipinas!!\\raymondd841\\Great hotel! Lots of dining options. The beach, though a bit rocky, has a lot of fishes roaming around which makes it exciting. It has a deep pool and entertainment center, with mini golf, tennis and billiards. The Chinese restaurant was great (thanks Rochelle for the assistance)! There is lechon every night at the main restaurant. Lastly, the Chi Spa experience is heavenly! Worth the price! Kudos to Fhelma and Noemi for the wonderful massage!\\WHATEVER33\\Great stay with kids and friends. Adventure zone staff great with kids and the quest given kept them occupied.  Lots of fishes in the ""beach"" Breakfast and lunch buffet were both good.  Great quick escape from manila.  Enjoyed the yoga class too.  Decided to go again for quick escape next month One peeve is they did not credit my shang circle rewards points"

We are checking into NuStar Fil hotel right after we checked out from Sheraton Mactan resort for 3 days and 3 nights. The difference between Sheraton and NuStar is like day and night when it comes to service.   We arrived in NuStar via LG parking lot. We arrived we multiple large luggage’s and although there are multiple hotel personnel standing by the x-ray machine no one dares to help us unload our stuff. After they x-rayed our bags no one guided us where to go and they just stand there and busy themselves chitchatting. We carried all our bags to the elevator.  At the check-in reception: it was very disorganized and it looks like that most personnel don’t even know what to do. While\\Iza p\\Everything is just perfect! Staff- extremely Polite and accommodating, your comfort is their Top Priority. Room- very big, even bigger (wink) is the bathroom. I like the beds and the interior of the room. Tastefully designed. Breakfast buffet- OMG this is especially wonderful. Their Menu is extensive and everything is just delicious.\\Sanitv\\I stayed here for 4 nights during recent trip to Cebu. The hotel is located in the complex with restaurants and casino. However, the mall section still under construction.  Check In and check out progress is slow but helpful staff. The room is wide and fully equipped, espacially very comfortable mattress. The breakfast was also good with varieties of western and local food.\\Angelica T\\Manager Johanne Espinosa, Head Concierge Stephen Santiago and Vince of the concierge team went above and beyond to assist guests. Even though the hotel was quite new, they responded to every request timely and attentively with a smile. Exceeded expectations for sure!\\Christopher P\\As part of the organizing council of ABAC in Cebu. I was amazed as we arrived at Fili Hotel. The hotel is modern, clean,stylish and very luxurious from lobby to convention and rooms, it was extremely elegant and spacious.The food was great too. The hotel employees were very friendly. Although, I would say that there is room for improvement in terms of service. In particular, as we were preparing  in the Convention Hall B for the plenary meeting. I requested one male wait staff for chairs to be placed in the control booth, I waited for the chairs for about 20 minutes but the guy did not come back, so I went out to the lobby and was waiting for him impatiently as we needed the chairs but I could not find him, until one female wait staff named Lyn approached me and asked if she\\Oleg Mikhailov\\I visited Cebu for the ABAC and stayed here. Excellent Service from the hotel staff, upon arrival I was given a welcoming drink by a tall pretty lady named Lyn, what caught my attention is her warm and welcoming smile. The orange fizz was refreshing by the way. The room was very spacious, clean and had the amenities needed. Breakfast was delicious and with many choices. The people in the reception were very helpful in checkin and check out. Transaction was smooth. The convention were we held the meetings was very clean and staffs were very quick to replenish water, pencils and paper. Coffee and tea was good and Lyn was there too always smiling and helpful in giving directions to spots. She also recommended Fina restaurant and food was great. The location is great and near\\NewYorkWorldExplorer\\The hotel is part of the Nustar resort in the South Reclamation area which is a few minutes away from all the tourist spots and Cebu’s business district. The rooms are sparkling new and have beautiful views of the Mactan Bridge, the water, downtown, and the hills which all light up nicely at night. The bathrooms are luxurious and all amenities are provided. The most enjoyable part of our stay was the breakfast buffet at the Fili Cafe. Food was delicious and service was top notch. At the time of our visit, the mall, the sauna and spa, and certain areas of Nustar resort were still under construction or not yet operational. I expect it to be a popular destination when the entire Nustar resort is fully operational in 2024. Thumbs up!\\Stephanie C\\I am curious about the newest & famous 5 star hotel in Cebu City! As a family, we decided to dine in FILI cafe. The name itself is classy and inviting as well. So we decided to try just this month of Julu & I was surprised by the authenticity of the food! It was soooo delish and worth every penny! PLUS, the staff named DAN who accommodated is was very witty and his services to us was outstanding! He made us feel comfortable always and he was mindful everytime we need some assistance. Dan is highly commendable if only I have more time to commend him at that moment. He is one of the best servers I have ever met! Will definitely dine again at Fili and looking forward for Dan to assist us. Kudos to the entire staff for the great service. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\\Travel@buckets\\Good modern business hotel  New facilities  Booked a sea view room  Check in was uneventful  Staff are very attentive  Some facilities are still not open at the time  Pool side has great views but there’s no bar service -(  Room ample space for 2 adults  Beds pillows are very comfortable  Breakfast was great - multiple Asian and western selections  Tried Fili restaurant which is within the premises and the food is not only good but reasonably priced  Overall stay was satisfactory , close enough to explore the City so I would stay here again.\\Lynne Smith\\This is one of the newest hotels in Cebu City, so our family opted to visit this place. The property is still under construction especially the Nustar hotel.  This place was great and you have plenty of great restaurants from Michelin star to great Steakhouse you can choose from. Also, the staff were all nice and accommodating, special mention to Jane from the front desk and to the housekeeping team who maintains our room clean and tidy. One thing I noticed though is that we kept hearing noises outside our room at some point during our stay so I figured it was not really a sound proof one. The breakfast buffet was mouthwatering even though the varieties were kinda limited. Overall it was a great stay and definitely coming back.\\Tim W\\Coffee and frappes were great, blueberry muffin was soft and not too sweet. The ambiance is very luxurious and comfortable. Prices not too high despite the location and 5-star hotel location. Elvie was very accommodating and helpful.\\Xheelah M\\Very accommodating crew. The food is really authentic and delicious. They also have a surprise sing and dance presentation for the birthday celebrant. The ambiance is good and they also have a very cold air-conditioning.\\Getaway39393312579\\I went with my work colleagues. Their food is very yummy food and they have friendly and best service! I will love to go back and dine with my family soon. By the way our server is Ran2x, a very kind server.\\ingrid b\\Always a great experience!

(We couldn't use the Grab application) Ericson, a front desk clerk, made a great effort to order the menu from his personal cell phone. It was very touching to try to fulfill the request that the hotel system could not make. While trying to order, Jollibee's business hours were over, so we couldn't eat it, but later he found a Jollibee that wasn't closed personally and showed it to us. (Then we were in the pool and he came to see us himself!) But we had already placed an order at the hotel restaurant Sunset Bar. I couldn't eat Jollibee because it was the last day of our trip, but I was very touched by his passionate service. All the facilities in the hotel were excellent, the staff were\\윤경 이\\Every employees are kind  I ate pizza and cocktails  I love here cocktails I fall in love with cosmopolitan  Thank u for good service !  It was good vacation If u visit sunset bar u can see nice scenery\\Mississippi Analytics\\The place is a slice of paradise, no doubt. The beach, the swanky rooms, it's like stepping into a dream. But here's the thing: their Wi-Fi game. I mean, you're in this stunning tropical heaven, but the Wi-Fi acts like it's on a beach vacation too – super slow and kinda unreliable. So if you're planning to upload all those jealousy-inducing beach pics or even just stream your favorite show, you might be in for some frustration. It's like paradise with a side of digital detox, whether you asked for it or not! 🏖️📶\\Michael T\\Very bad check-in experience, they were able to give the requested room at 3:45 pm where in the checkin time is 3 pm.  Unprofessional front desk manager and receptionists.  Pricey buffet food, not so special and they are very slow in refilling the food items.  Would not recommend this place\\OnAir684175\\Our stay at the Dusit Thani was exceptional. From the moment we checked in we could not fault the resort or the service.

The room itself is quite basic same as the bathroom for the price paid or for a Dusit Thani hotel.  A bathtub would have been nice as commented by my son.  Bath towels seem like beach towels, they were too big. We were told that our rooms have king sized beds, there were twin beds.  (+) Dusit Thani hospitality still felt and happy about it. Great staff from the arrival, restaurants, housekeeping, pool, ground, they were friendly and genuine. No problem with parking.  Sunset view was superb either from the infinity pool or the bar.

I would recommend to my friends, and will definitely stay again if Im back to Cebu.\\stevekettle\\Fun place - rooms good and serviced well , good F&B , service can be hit & miss but generally with a smile , so as long as you not in a rush all good .

And place was convenient to eat because it was right in front of the swimming pool!!    Also the cocktail recommendation was very good :) thanks!!\\chunghun ha\\I stayed at the Dujithani Hotel for 2 nights and 3 days and used the club lounge. The memories here were so good. Both afternoon tea and dinner-time services provided the best food, location and service. The staff here, especially Gerson, was kind, took pictures of us, and treated us very well. If I come to the Philippines next time, I will use the Dujithani Hotel again and reserve a club room where the club lounge is always available.\\Martha M\\I admire everything! This place is very tremendous, charming and lavish. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. Facilities are great and modern. The pool was very beautiful and warm.

The only suggestion I have for improvement would be to consider adding Netflix to the television options, as the available channels were limited. Nonetheless, the outstanding service and impeccable rooms make this hotel highly recommendable for anyone seeking a top-notch stay in the area, and I eagerly anticipate my return in the future.\\Elsa F\\Good customer service and good food i would like to comment to jules in charleys bar hes very friendly good drinks also and i meet a lot of friends i will be back for sure i will try the hotel check in.

We were told to wait for the room as they're still setting up the extra bed (with paid extra person charge).  but when we entered the room there was no extra bed and we had to call room service to set it up.   2.  Before booking I contacted the hotel via FB messenger to inquire about extra person charge (16 years old).  I was told that rate per night  is 1200 no breakfast or 1800 with breakfast - but upon checking in we were obliged by receptionist Shao to pay for the extra with breakfast as according to him it is required for extra person to have breakfast.. I asked twice and told him that I know it's not required but he insisted that it is required... I don't know who's not telling the truth (your messenger admin or the receptionist?)  3.  We're required to have breakfast\\bennever l\\The place was very clean and well maintained. The staff are very friendly helpful and accommodating…. Had a great experience.

Would definitely recommend this to my family and friends. Best dish: grilled seafood and veggies. Their desserts are also a must!\\sohweiliu\\The hotel is very old, and it’s very humid and it smells very bad when you walk out the elevator. The only good one is it’s close to the metro mall, and the concierge person is very nice, he helped us to book the greatest massage-CHEEVA.\\glenah c\\Delightful dishes choices with a lot of choices from mixed asian cuisines to Italian dishes .

Over a period of ten days, I had the privilege of enjoying the exceptional hospitality and top-notch service of this hotel.  Erica truly stood out to me. Her tireless diligence and constant dedication are remarkable. She was always on the move, ensuring that everything in the restaurant was in perfect order, all with remarkable discipline. Her dedication and commitment are palpable and made my stay even more enjoyable.  Franz is a true asset to the hotel. His consistent friendliness and sincere efforts to provide guests with the best possible service impressed me. His regular coffee service and unobtrusive inquiries about my well-being made me feel"
