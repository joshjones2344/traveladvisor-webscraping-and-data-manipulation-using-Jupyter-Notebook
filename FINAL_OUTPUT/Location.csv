She had a pleasant stay & said the place was clean & tidy. She was picked up by the shuttle from the airport on time. All meals were part of the package which was excellent. Quality of meals was good. Thanks guys for what you do in these crazy times. All the best.\\MaasGolf\\We spent  just one night in one of their junior suites. Huge room with a little kitchen. Wonderful small quiet pool with in water seating directly at the pool bar. Very friendly helpful staff. Outlet mall and many restaurants within a few minutes walking distance. Fantastic breakfast and a free shuttle van to the airport early in the morning. Can definitely recommend if passing through Mactan/Cebu City.\\Lucy P\\We stayed here for 1 night to catch our flight early morning.  It was such good value for money and we had a free upgrade on checking in which was a lovely surprise after a long day!  The room had loads of space and was really clean.  We went to the outlet shopping next door that had Nike, Adidas etc   The restaurant had really nice food, we both had sandwiches and a bucket of beer for good value - big shout out for Argie who was so lovely.   The airport shuttle was included in the stay which you need to book when you check in, it was so easy and quick!\\Jude Palces\\I had a wonderful 2 days at Eloisa's. The property is 15-20 minutes from the airport.There is an outlet nearby for shopping and dining. Everything started right with a free shuttle from the airport. Check-in was seamless and easy. What really set this property apart from other hotels, in my opinion, was the friendly and caring staff. I had a Junior Suite and it was huge. The sheets smelled fresh. Bathroom was clean and had all the amenities one expects from a hotel. Free breakfast was excellent with a lot of choices. The live band in Daku Bistro really added a nice touch to total experience. I did not try the pool but it is aesthetically designed and looks really pretty at night. I will definitely return to this place the next time I am in town.\\Aillen L\\At first glance, we thought that it’s just a simple hotel, but when we checked-in.. it was totally beyond expectation. + Room- stylish and spacious with excellent Wi-Fi. Bathroom is small but it’s fine. Breakfast-i love the buffet and the staff were nice. Place- I’m soo in love with the place and it’s like you’re in a resort. Pool- Nah! Soo beautiful and with stylish curtains. It’s even more nice at night. Good for kiddos. - Location- It’s away from the downtown, but it’s not fine since there are malls with fantastic restaurants and boutiques beside the hotel.\\42Veggies\\Would be a five star review had they not put us in room 203, facing the main road. The honking all night did not help our jetlagged bodies to fall asleep.  Also the second night the people in room 204 arrived at 4 am heavily intoxicated, they were screaming in the hall ways and after half an hour took their noise into their room, the one next to ours, and continued loudly screaming and laughing until I got out of bed, got dressed, went into the hallway and yelled at them to shut up. Really we were right above the reception and the staff should have adressed this situation within minutes.  But back to the rave review because the hotel really is very good. The beds are very comfortable, the room is immaculately clean and very nice and well equiped, the staff go out of their way to\\Meggy\\We stayed at Eloisa Royal Suite for a night since it was near the airport and we have an early flight the next day. We arranged our transfer-in with them and they were very flexible. Our flight was delayed (we arrived at 10 pm) and when we called, they said they have a flight tracker so we need not worry. Check-in was a breeze and we were upgraded to an executive room. Our room is nice, it has access to the pool🙂. I guess whether the room has a window or not will depend on the type of room you booked. They have a takeaway breakfast for those who have an early flight. You may choose between bacon with rice or tuna sandwich. My only comment is that wifi is a bit slow in our room. Overall we had a wonderful night and will stay here again if we go back to Mactan Cebu.\\LJ V\\The hotel looks nice but the room is smaller than I thought. The staffs are really helpful. Food is good could be better. They have free shuttle so it's good to consider it airport hotel it's not that far but always leave early Cebu always have chaos traffic.\\94klj\\Great hotel in a great location. Ideal for people looking to stay near the airport, although not much in the surrounding area. The room was very clean and a decent size. The reception staff were extremely helpful when we were checking in and at all other times. We had two early morning trips and had breakfast prepared for us on departure. Was great for a two night stay over between destinations.\\RaynerAO\\My 2nd stay here and I wasn’t disappointed at all. My stay at Eloisa was very pleasant. Location wise, it was great for me. Food area probably 5 mins walk away? Outlet shops too for those who want to shop. Close to airport too.  The staff were really helpful and approachable. My room (located in the same building as the lobby) was clean, comfortable (toilet too) and everything functioned well.  For those who want to keep fit, their gym, though small, was clean and well equipped with proper machines and weights.  The best experience though was when I was done with work for the day (late afternoon), had already checked out in the morning but was sticky and sweaty. I wanted to book a room for a couple of hours just to freshen up but was instead lead by the staff to their guest\\Littlelizamay\\The staff are friendly and helpful. The room was clean with a fridge, kettle, and tv. as well as hairdryer. It is near the airport and the hotel has its own transport which is very useful. It would have been great if there was some form of ""welcome pack"" in the room detailing the services available in the hotel as well as a list of attractions nearby.\\Max W\\My girlfriend and I booked this hotel quite late during the day due to our flight rescheduling. We decided to choose this hotel due to the close proximity to the Mactan Airport on the map. We did request pick-up from the airport in our online booking, however as it was late during the day, the hotel may not have seen it.  When we landed at almost midnight, not to our surprise, we were unable to find any hotel personnel for the pick-up service. We called the hotel and they said that the driver was already at the airport, however they were not able to tell us where exactly the driver was waiting. It was made more confusing as the airport has a number of exits. We called the hotel a number of times and explained our exact location where we would be waiting, and after an hour or so\\Zhaun O\\When checking in, please ask for a room on the new wing where rooms are smaller but are more thought-out and have a view of the pool and are away from the road (read: less traffic noise)  Here is the lowdown:  1. Free airport transfer 2. Buffet breakfast 3. Luscious sheets, down (duck feather) pillows. They gave me dour pillows on my Queen-sized bed 4. Awesome customer service! Everyone greets you with a smile 5. Walk from the lobby to room is about 50-meters but they insist to drive u via gold cart 6. I asked how much their bottled water is (was thirsty), they insisted on giving it to me for free on top of the 2 bottles that was already in my room 7. You can get a poolside room for as low as 3500 8. They'll be offering speedboat island tours soon! 9. It's near Plantation Bay\\Danny\\This hotel was incredible. Seemed like it was newly renovated and they were looking for a super modern look. It was good. I could tell that they were kind of limited on space, but they still did great with the space they had. I actually received a message through Orbitz, from the staff, asking when I would arrive and if I needed pickup from airport/wherever. That was very nice. Check in was smooth and painless. The room was very nice, bed very soft, bathroom was very nice, but the room was a bit small. Which was fine because that's the room I selected, but it was still very nice. Checked in, showered, then walked about 5 minutes to this strip mall/restaurant area nearby, where there are many many food/shop options. Right next door to the hotel is a massage place, reasonable\\Ian C\\During my second stay here, the staff never failed to give me a very relaxing stay. Their tireless but genuine greetings, quality service and more vibrant hotel will make you decide to stay here again and again.  The wedding that i would be attending is pretty far from here but knowing how Eloisa crews take care of their guests, I don't mind traveling farther coz I can't sacrifice that relaxing stay I wanna achieve this time.   Thank you ERS! Keep up the good work! 😊\\Divina A\\Just the best of the best, our second stay in this hotel, rooms are clean, big, comfy beds and modern, they have free shuttle from the airport, breakfast is amazing, everybody that works at the hotel are just super nice. Thank you again for the great stay, we will see you guys soon.  Salamat\\Beth I\\We flew into Cebu airport late and they provided a very nice van shuttle for free. The rooms are nice and clean. Very modern. The bed was so comfortable I forgot we were in Asia! The staff are helpful and friendly. We recommend this place to anyone. Only negative thing was the traffic noise starting about 6am but it wasn't terrible, you could just hear it. We will stay here again!\\Littledeans\\Best hotel in Lapu-Lapu city, they provide free airport transfer. Massage center just right next door of the hotel and easy access. Area surrounded by the Nike factory outlet there are Puma, Giodano, Levis, Adidas, timbeland and so on. There are Robinson market store for your convenience, and also 7 eleven, Love this hotel will all the friendly staff especially the bell boy,security and receptionist. They provide hairdryer the most important things that i would like to put a comment. Due to the hot weather and caused that taking shower few times a day hair dryer are seriously needed by me (May be for other tourist as well)\\jneth5\\Love this place! I booked Eloisa so we have a place to stay during our long lay overs in Mactan, Cebu (from and to USA). I love that they have a free airport shuttle service. It gave me so much peace of mind that we are being taken care of especially that we were transiting in the odd hours of the night. Many thanks to Oscar Luna of the concierge. I commend him for his hard work and care for my family. He is very polite and extended valuable tips and information. Thank you, Oscar!   Eloisa also offer a shuttle service with minimal fee if you desire to go places or arranged for pick up.   A massage parlor is located next door, which comes handy to work the kinks out of your body after the long flights.   Food is no problem. They have a restaurant on the first floor.   The hotel\\Len D\\Accommodating  and friendly  staff, neat and clean room. We stayed 2 days in a suite room and 2 days in a deep Luxe room. The weekend dinner buffet  was absolutely  great. I love their pasta and pancit that the chef will cook live according  to your liking.\\BDCE\\This is a great hotel for budget conscious travelers or business travelers who just need a place to sleep after a hectic day.  This is a relatively new hotel. Value for money hotel.  LOCATION:  About 10 to 15 minutes from the Airport. Walking distance to Robinson's grocery, factory outlets of such brands as Adidas, Oakley, Giordano, Converse, etc, and dining establishments.  A ride away from the Island mall.  Along the main road and accessible to public transportation. Free airport transfers.  ROOM: We booked the room with 3 single beds.  Room was big but with no windows. furnishing is quite modern.  Room and bathroom were clean.  Bathroom has a shower with hot water.  FOOD:  The only restaurant in the hotel is quite small but serves good food.  Grilled tuna belly is highly\\ziggy2l\\When we checked in from Mactan Airport, we made the mistake of not using the free shuttle service from the hotel. The cab fare was not that bad anyways, just hard for some taxi driver to find the place because it is new. The hotel itself is nice and new, for the promo price; it's worth it. Staff was helpful specially the security guards. There was this one waiter that was hard to communicate with but it was a minor thing. The bathroom sometimes smelled funky and our room was hard to find, it was like a maze. But let me emphasize that all of these were minor.\\Vinay-OnTheGo\\Stayed for a Day in the hotel with my chinese friends. Very nice and friendly hotel staff. Clean Hotel, Nice service, 15 minutes drive from the Cebu Airport. Had to check-out early morning at 5 but the hotel arranged a free shuttle although it was raining and packed our breakfast too.  Very nice and comfortable stay!\\jodyk505\\Stayed one night on Tuesday, September 16th before catching a flight from Cebu to Puerto Princesa the next day.  Was greeted by the receptionist and she handled check in tasks superbly explaining everything comprehensively.  The rooms were spotless and the hotel was very quiet.  The breakfast buffet is awesome and if you feel like pampering yourself, head over to the spa and massage parlor right next door.  Very close to Mactan Cebu and Robinson Supermarket and factory store outlet.\\ALLAN S\\Stayed 2 nights for business in the area. *10 mins drive from the airport. *Short walk to Outlet Store, Robinsons Supermart, 7-11, Mcdonalds, restos. *hotel looks and feels new. *airport shuttle available. *buffet breakfast...good selection. *wifi, cable tv, a/c. *beds and pillows are memory foam...slept very well. *toilet and bath...very good.\\djali9\\This is a great place to stay. The staff are friendly and the service is excellent. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Not every room has a window, so keep that in mind when booking. We booked as a large adult family group, and emailed prior to arrival; the staff were excellent, sorting out our complicated booking and accommodating all our requests. My baggage was delayed at the airport, but the staff were very helpful and called to sort out delivery of my suitcase for me. The hotel is in a good location for looking around both the cities of Lapu Lapu and Cebu.  I would definitely stay here again!\\JenTravelMeHappy\\This hotel was one of the best we had so far on the Philippines. The room was really nice, the shower was great, the bed comfortable, the WIFI worked in our room, the staff was very friendly and especially the onion soup from the inhouse restaurant was very delicious. Also the shuttle to the airport was free.\\Kit Yeung\\I spend almost three night in Eloisa because of there staff and teams is really the best, they all friendly and hard work, whatever u ask they will do it and try to be very helpful, they are the great team to serve the customer well. i have been travelling many countries and city and i bn visited different hotel but i find Eloisa is just like your home in cebu, u just missed them even i leave cebu and i return back again to check in Eloisa when i need hotel in cebu, i am also a budget traveller but i find it worth to pay more for they service because the bed is the most comfortable in cenu, and clean, the room is not to big as photo, this is one of the issue i talk to them, but except that the breakfast is a bit not western so i request for a western toast and sausage breakfast\\Sweetcath\\Well,no more I can say to this hotel. From the driver, guard to all the staff of this hotel. I and my husband are very proud and happy while we stay to this hotel. We felt like we are home becausw of the staff. Very energetic, always smile😁☺😀😊. Not like the other hotel we stay to mention(the bellavista hotel).,I really don't like the staff there. And by the way we had our free breakfast for 3 nights and the foods are very delicious,and also we try to eat their foods for lunch which is `TUNA BAGAYBAY,STEAMED TUNA STICK and GINGER SOUP "" All their foods are very delicious. Also the place is near the Outlets for shoes products.You can walk for 2-3 mins. And easy to get taxi wherever you go.because its near in terminal. I hopw to stay again in this hotel for next vacation. I and\\Eonlight\\Clean and modern room with free wifi, free shuttle and buffet breakfast, in fact they made us a special omelet that morning which we really appreciate of their kindness. All staffs are great and very hospitable.   The restaurant, lift and check in/out counter is all in one compact space. In fairness management did their best in maximising the space for the functions, a credit to them. Also it would be good if windows are double glaze for noise reduction from traffic all night.  A much decent place to stay in Mactan and Cebu in comparison to other accommodations around and a good base if you like to go to the beach around Mactan Island. Highly recommended to travellers. Value for money.\\Kim C\\This hotel Lacks a pool and a beach, however, that is fine because you can travel to another resort to use theirs.  The thai massage business located next door provides excellent services and very affordable prices.  The food and the service at this hotel was quick and sufficient. My breakfast was included and it was good. The prices for buffet dinner was affordable and good at p399/person. The room I booked was a deluxe and was so tiny for two people. However, it was very clean and new and I only needed it for two nights.  The location is in a busier area next to the outlet stores and other stores, walking distance. Short ride to the malls and to the city. It's a bit sketchy at night of outside the hotel.\\Desidel\\This is a very nice place to stay, I stayed here July 2015. Perfect location for shops, airport and trips to Lapu Lapu Cebu City also. Very friendly staff, couldn't do enough to help you, the rooms were very good to, nice and clean. Food here was good, Wi Fi ok, airport transfer included . I will definitely stay here again, everything here was good, I couldn't find any faults. This is a good place to stay. Thanks to all the friendly staff.\\Graeme M\\Very comfortable hotel , Biggest bed ever with the most pillows,comfort plus, Large room with microwave , Grill oven , full size under bench fridge , Always given clean towel and  a room clean every day.   The breakfast was sumptuous with a nice range , The best of all was the lovely helpful pleasant staff making our stay the best ever . Thank you all so much.\\erezmazor\\if you're en-route this place is really close to the Cebu airport. Clean and nice and the staff is really sweet. The rooms have no window but the AC is working great so it's not stuffy. All in all this is a great spot to spend a night or two.\\Samuel D\\I had a fantastic stay in Eloisa. The rooms were very comfortable, clean and great value for money. The staff were all very accommodating and attentive to my every need. The hotel pick-up and drop off were a bonus with friendly and careful drivers. The breakfast was sumptuous and wifi was great. i will surely come back again soon.\\appmountaingirl\\About 10-15 minutes from the airport, Eloisa is a great pick for early-morning flights.  The hotel is still quite new, and the rooms (though very small) were comfortable and pristine.  After 2 weeks in 4 other hotels in Asia, this was the most comfortable bed out of all of them!  Staff were exceptionally helpful, offering to pack us a breakfast (at no charge) for our 3:45 AM departure.  Shuttle to the airport was scheduled at a time that suited us, not stuck to an on-the-hour schedule.   About 25 minutes from Cebu City shopping, about 15 minutes from Lapu-Lapu beach areas, and about 15 minutes from the airport.    Highly recommended!\\DonPedros\\Having been appointed a night at the Eloisa by the airline due to a cancelled flight, the choice to stay here was not one in which I was involved by other means than accepting the offer by the airline. Being located very close to Mactan Intl. Airport in Cebu, it's great for people with airport activities. The rooms are small, but they are modern, clean and well equipped. Our room on the top floor had issues such as non-functioning sockets, leaking showers, non-functional phones, sporadically non-functional elevator and other minor issues, however I should empathise they were minor issues. The food from the cafe in the hotel was decent, however it was with great disappointment that I found that their Tuna was not real Tune, but ""White Tuna"", or rather the variant which actually\\Eddie AMS\\Learned about this hotel via Tripadvisor and booked it based on good reviews.  Service is really good in this hotel. All staff are friendly and very helpful. The room rate is reasonable and location is good if you prefer to stay in Mactan Island and closer to the airport. There is a factory outlet with some dining options within easy walking distance.   I booked a superior room. The room is nice and clean. The only downside was that there is no window and wifi coverage is very very minimal to zero. But, for the price that you pay, it compensated the aforesaid and we could always go to the lobby for better internet coverage.   To add, this hotel provides free airport transfers. You just need to inform them your flight details once you've made your bookings, regardless of booking",,,,,,

Can't wait to be back there for my last night in Cebu tomorrow! Here is why: -the check-in was smooth and fast.  -ideally situated right next to Ayala Center -staff at the concierge is very knowledgeable and knows how to help people and give good advices. -the room is BIG! And overall good cleanliness. It was not ""spotless"" because the hotel is not new. Some things look used but absolutely not dirty. We asked for more toilet paper and the houseman who came saw that we had no bottles of water (actually we put them in the fridge haha) so he brought us two extra more without us asking anything. Good hotelier sense! -the breakfast was A-MA-ZING. Lots of choices to please every client (asian + western dishes) -we also used the\\bob1cat\\We stayed two nights at the Mandarin Plaza hotel which is about 300M walk to the Ayala mall if you need to go shopping.  The hotel does not have a shuttle to the airport or harbor for ferry service but taxi's are available for 250 - 500 pesos.  The breakfast buffet was better than we expected with both hot and cold items to choose from. Refills were no problem.  A few items on the buffet change daily.  If we needed to visit the Ayala mall we would stay there again.\\Olivia d\\This hotel is fabulous, not only is it centrally located but the hotel has everything you want..reasonably priced, spotless rooms, great showers and good wifi. The hotel has a pool, sauna and restaurant. We ate here two nights and the food was delicious and cheap too. The staff were what made the stay however, they were so helpful and friendly, from the concierge to the wait staff. So thank-you!\\Teresa B\\The room was spacious, clean and the food at breakfast was alright. Though at the time of checking in there was one lady on duty, it took a little bit of time to get my turn in the queue, but at least she gave me the room on the 17th floor. It was quiet and good view of the city lights.\\livi88\\Good standard hotel. Room Was clean and comfortable. Food is average but very reasonable. Very friendly staff. Ideal location for Cebu city - directly across from the mall. Not a whole heap to do in Cebu city itself but good location to do day trips from.\\Cameron B\\On my first impression of the room was wow...it was a great size, very spacious. Staff were always friendly and helpful, especially when i asked for a TV remote control, as the rooms only come with a cable TV remote and i wanted to play media from my personal hard drive. Buffet breakfast was good, plenty of choices, both western and Asian cuisine available...the only negative i found was the bacon...not everyone likes crispy bacon. Location is great, a short walk to Ayala Mall and the must try House of Lechon (it was so good i went back 2 nights in a row) Pool was good, gym was a little hard to find (not that i used it) Overall i enjoyed my stay at the Mandarin Plaza Hotel and when i visit Cebu again, i wont hesitate booking here again.\\CheriedPretty\\My mother and I stayed in this hotel overnight and boy, I was surprised how the hotel's interior design and magnificent color mesmerized me. the entrance lobby looked so grand with crystal chandelier hanging over an oversized centerpiece. The room (superior room) was equipped with ref, hair dryer, slippers, laundry bags, and complimentary drinks. Although there was nothing on the bar, still i appreciate the cleanliness and orderliness of the entire room. The room service was prompt and the restaurant was open until 11:30PM! The food selection was not many but sufficently delicious and varied...there are cereals and congee for the kids too. the breads are fresh. This hotel definitely deserve my second visit!\\Arra Ezekiel N\\Pro - Near shopping center / Ayala IT Park (3-5 mins walk) - Near the pier (20mins by car) - Food is great - Accommodating and very kind staff - Clean and spacious room and toilet. - taxis are lined up outside - fast internet connection  Cons - Same breakfast menu everyday (buffet) - When I stayed there last April 1 2018, the bedsheets had stains and the bath towel was frayed and torn - 45mins travel from the airport\\Dorothy W\\Really enjoyed my stay here. Warm friendly welcome. The hotel is close to Ayala mall which has a large selection of shops, bars and restaurants. Room very clean and communal areas. Staff helpful and professional.\\Richard H\\First, let me speak of the hotel. This was my second stay, and it would have been my third, had they not been booked up on my last minute trip a month before. I love this place and the staff, not to mention the close proximity to the large mall. I’ve done a lot of traveling in the U.S. and across Asia. Often, even nice places have flaws and aging, especially in the bathrooms. This place is always spotless and in excellent condition. On this stay, I needed a toothbrush, and seeing an employee in the hall, mentioned it. She wasn’t a housekeeper and didn’t have anything with her, but when I returned to my room, two toothbrushes and extra T/P awaited me. Now, for the rave. I was extremely stressed on this trip and did something totally out of character: I left my passport and PHP\\Steve J\\I travel...A LOT!  This was my first stay at the Mandarin, and I will be back! It is conveniently located to Ayala Mall and many other Cebuano musts...like great cuisine and professional massage parlors, such as Nuai Thai, just a stones throw from the Mandarin, but well worth the short walk.    I arrived late at night from the USA, so a speedy, helpful, and friendly check-in process was a must. Justine and Christian made this possible! My room was clean, comfortable, and the aircon was good...but not great. The bed was amazing, and the WiFi way more than adequate! The rooms are also very spacious, which is helpful since most international travelers arrive with a lot of luggage.    The breakfast buffet, which is included with your room, was very good, and the pancit canton I had\\loida gac-ang\\I enjoyed while staying at this beautiful place.They have yummy and unlimitted food.Good ambiance at the dining place. Accomodating staff and crew. The place were very nice and so accessible because it is located near the mall.\\JinDee8\\We enjoyed our stay at the Mandarin Plaza. Our room was very spacious, and we really appreciated the complimentary bottled water, and coffee bar. The hotel was nice and clean, and staff was friendly and accommodating. Our only gripe is the limited selection for the breakfast buffet, but we are grateful that they even offer it for free, so can't really complain. We recommend this hotel, especially if you want to be close to Ayala Center.\\Marlaine Hope R\\Aside from booking a room for an affordable price, the place was huge and just enough for my active two year old son to run around to his heart content. Cozy and spacious. Breakfast was a buffet of sumptuous food. A feast for my eyes and stomach early in the morning.\\Aggeliki K\\Beautiful hotel with nice rooms and pleasant environment, tight in the central of the city. I tried the cocktails at night with relaxing live piano music. The rooms are quite big and nice, and friendly staff.\\Patricia P\\Loved staying at this hotel.  Breakfast buffet was fantastic with different food options available.  Room service facilities excellent, such as house slippers and bag for groceries.  Tea and coffee with fresh water provided every day.\\Nicx\\This hotel is value for money. It's hard to find a hotel in the heart of Cebu City with a bath tub for two thousand pesos. The hotel is clean, big, with free breakfast, tasty in-room dining service, walking distance to a mall, with pool, bar, restaurant and friendly staff. Will come back if I am in Cebu again.\\Seaside750551\\They are very strict with the check in and out times, but they have great rooms and facilities and delicious buffet. The location is convenient to Ayala Malls but a bit crowded. I would recommend this.\\The Aimless traveller\\If you’re a solo or business traveler needing peace and quiet, keep in mind that it’s full of group tourists and families, and in a crowded part of Cebu. Otherwise it’s an excellent comfortable hotel with all amenities, good breakfast and polite staff.\\Judfae M\\I checked in on July 7 and out on the 9th with a friend. I was surprised by the spacious room with basic amenities. You can have the other needs upon request.   I thought the rate would be much higher..but it was affordable.  It was easy for us to go to and from Ayala, Cebu as it was just across the street.    Hotel staff and maintenance were friendly and professional.  Buffet breakfast was really nothing extraordinary..but just fine for what you pay. I would still look forward to staying in the same hotel in the future.",,,,,,

Staff are very accomodating and efficient. Rooms are clean and compact which is perfect for work trips. The wifi maybe spotty at times and need to be upgraded.\\Grace G\\Amazing location! The hotel is situated in the city proper and is very close to Starbucks (opens 6:30am-12mn) and malls (Ayala mall, Metro, and Rustan's). 7-11(convenience store) is located at the ground floor of the hotel and is open 24hrs. The guards are very friendly and so was every other staff at the hotel. They have ample parking space and it's clean. This is also where the smoking area is located. It's easy to travel from the hotel to any part of Cebu city whether thru taxi, motorcycle, or PUV. The water pressure is really nice. The wifi works and is fast. Their lobby is kinda small but cozy and clean.\\ryanazuro\\Don't missed the opportunity to check-in at Red Planet Cebu. Where the center of all amenities in the city.

Good ambiance. Cool aircon. Nice architectural. Superb staff.from ground floor, parking to receptionist to housekeeping. Good view of the tall buildings in the vicinity. Walking distance Metro and Ayala malls.\\giuliodH4485HG\\Quality, clean, comfortable--from entering the building, the lift, hallway, up to the room. Truly a great value for your $$$.  Food is not a problem because there are lots of good restaurants outside with just a quick stroll away. Transportation is not a problem either. I was given a 4th floor room and the window has a nice view of night lights and tall nearby buildings.\\guilarue1990\\Perfect 2 nights with nice staff and when needed to extend our stay thr staff made it easy and quick and hassle free. Really enjoyable stay and room was really nice and clean. I limed that we are in control of when we want our room to be clean.\\Vicky\\This place has a great location. Their staff are very friendly and accommodating. I arrived too early before check-in time and I was a bit surprised when they told me that my room is ready. I got an early check in free of charge, and I didn’t even have to ask for it.Thank you very much. I would surely stay here again.\\Michelle A.\\Everything! I have stayed in various Red Planet locations and most of the time they have exceeded my expectations. Same for this stay because the location, amenities, cleanliness, and value for money were all excellent.  I would also like to commend the staff because they were extremely helpful and went beyond expectations, especially Charish at the front desk! She helped us find a nice transport service from Cebu City to Moalboal after almost being scammed by a GrabCar driver.  I will definitely stay in Red Planet Cebu when I am back in the city!\\Julian Q\\Stayed here for 3nights and it’s well maintained. Very clean and simple not bad for a 2 star hotel. The good thing here is its very near in ayala mall just walking distance. Staff’s are mababait :) I recommend this to those travellers solo, friends or family :)\\Go21623383376\\this was my first time at the red planet hotel in Cebu City. It was an outstanding experience and I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody that visits Cebu City. You are definitely not be disappointed\\HeartyMixNutriClub\\Comfy place to stay. Towel is big and clean. Bed is just enough, linens are clean, generally the room is nice. The only thing i dont like guard below the belong not friendly and it difficult to park to go down from car\\Alvin\\Strategic location near the Ayala Mall Cebu and the environs. Quiet room is good located at the back side of the hotel. Internet connections terribly slow, friendly staff and security personnel. But relatively expensive for a good value hotel compare to other local hotel chains.\\Ray\\got a clean room and good valueable place to stay , and got really polite and friendly receptionist ever, this hotel also provide you wifi , and internet corner to use , good for business trip,got a convinience store beside\\kberna868078\\the room is clean, as well as the bathroom. comfortable bed. strong wifi and aircon. very nice place to stay with good service and staffs. will surely book again when I go home to the Philippines soon.\\Explore780638\\I love it.

I love my stay :)\\Gordon K\\Very clean, good beds, good linens, good locations, parking, lots of hot water in clean showers. They cover all the basic requirements very well and keep the room sizes on the smaller end so they keep the price down\\BPFerreira\\I stayed in this hotel after traveling around Cebu Island on my own. The hotel is perfect for a short or long stay. Rooms are a good size for one person, but they might get a bit small for a couple. The water pressure was excellent and the bed was extremely comfortable. Internet works perfectly.\\Brijraj S\\Professional business budget hotel. No frills are provided. Their methods are new but practical and if very low price but good value is what you need....  choose Red Planet. Located opposite Ayala mall so lots to do in the free time.\\kcsant0s\\I will recommend Red Planet Hotel-Cebu to my friends who are going to Cebu. It was a good overnight experience in the hotel. Was able to go quickly to Ayala mall. I wish breakfast was served within the hotel :)\\Marc Ian O\\I stayed here 2 nights. And it was a memorable experience. The place is near to Ayala Mall and few minutes from the Airport. There is a convenience store just a few steps away for an easy snacks and needs. Staff are very friendly and professional. They will attend to you promptly with courtesy. There is also a covered parking space. I will definitely visit again this place.\\Girley B\\The first Red Planet Hotel I stayed was RP Aseana and since then, wherever I go, I always choose this hotel. The rooms are small but enough for me, but I like the double bed, clean sheets, huge toilet, clean room, courteous and friendly staff.\\FrequentFlier11295\\Coveniently located (close to Ayala), effecient & professional service, & wallet-friendly price. had a pleasant stay. The only thing I don't like is this review requires a minimum of 2020 characters..\\artogle\\Good location, clean rooms, clean linens, reasonable price, excellent staff! Near my office, and the mall.   Everything inside the room is white, white linens, white bathroom, depicting cleanliness.  Reasonably priced.  All the staff are approachable, accomodating, helpful.\\cesargalleno\\when you enter to your room you will amaze since its very clean and  have a comfortable beds to sleep, then  the amenities are also good. The location is easy to locate and its near in a department store.\\John\\Paid ~PHP6,100 for 3nights in mid-July 2018.   Just the bare essentials in the room but clean.  Central enough location to Cebu City and Mandaue City although a bit far from Lapu-Lapu City.  Easy enough to get a GrabCar.  If you have your own car, they have free on-site parking with security guard - ask him to help direct traffic if you're having difficulty merging - don't forget to tip!\\MayMay1222\\The place was so nice and the service was excellent. Truly a good place to stay especially it was located in the heart of the city. And also, what I like most is the security. You will never worry about being harmed because of their unique security that I never experienced in other hotels.",,,,,,

My fiancee and I booked this hotel, when we went to get into the bed, I noticed brown stains on the sheet, which was excrement. The manager came and said the sheets and room were cleaned. She basically accused me of dirtying the sheets. I then actually dropped my shorts and bent over and said look at my back side and you will see its clean. We immediately packed and left the hotel for a budget hotel. At no stage did the manager attempt to find us another room! Will never go to this hotel again!//OceanLovingCouple//Mostly good experiences with well maintained rooms, good wifi etc.  We chose it as is close to Pier to get waterjet to Bohol and half the price of Radission Blu just down the road a bit further.  Cons are noise and crowds.  There are vehicles blaring airhorns in the middle of the night and the siren from the port every couple hours. The crowds at breakfast are daunting. Checkin and checkout chaotic crowding in lobby.  Only two elevators so often must wait and will be packed in like sardines.//dabawenyo//I have stayed here for 3 nights. It is a brand new budget hotel in Cebu City, perfectly well located next to SM City, ports going to nearby islands and provinces, a bus terminal going to places with beautiful tourists attraction particularly Bantayan Island. A very busy hotel, rates include buffet breakfast. The daily breakfast is always packed. It is 2 mins walk to SM but the 7/11 convenience store at the lobby is definitely a plus factor. I am staying here again in August 2023 before flying to our final destination for our family holiday in the Philippines!//Edwin R//This hotel was good for the area. It’s always hot and muggy so a nice cool room is always good. Spacious and welcoming. The staff was great. Lots to do in the area walking or riding. Have to look for the nite life.//Sandy_Star2012//Booked this hotel last minute as a ""stop-over"".    Pros: The front desk staff were very professional. The room was ready and clean and had all the amenities needed, including hair dryer and slippers. They also have a clothes line in the bathroom where you can hang wet swimwear etc. Bed was comfortable and we had a good night's rest. It can be noisy at dawn due to the bus station just across the street.  There's a restaurant, ATM, 7-11 at the ground floor and a gym at the 6th floor.  Cons - it can get chaotic during breakfast. I saw some guests not having a place to sit. In my view, the staff should seat the guests and also have tables for 2 to maximize the space.//Run around traveller//The hotel it self are fine for a 3 star. Superior Room spacious enough with good shower pressure. Can be noisy due to group checking and talking loudly in the room corridor.   The location apart of close to the main shopping mall, nothing else surrounding there. The hotel location are not close to airport.   Breakfast time are crazy busy due to many groups traveller, my first day breakfast have over 80 to 100 schools teenagers fit into the small size restaurant. Food is below average.//Liau Yuan Wei//We stayed one night there as we returned from Bohol, before we flew off back him the next day. Location: Very close to the airport (30mins ride) and also directly opposite of SM Cebu, one of the largest malls in Cebu City.  Amenities: When we entered our room, we saw a big wardrobe with hangers and a safe to the right of us. However the safe couldn’t be used as it was permanently locked. To the left was the toilet which was pretty well equipped I would say. We each had a set of toothpaste, toothbrush and cup. An interesting thing was there was a thin string as a clothing line inside the shower cubicle. There was also an anti-slip mat too. Note that there’s no bathtub. The bedroom had 2 double decker beds that look like army bunks 😳 The sheets weren’t totally clean as I spotted//Kasumi R//Overall: 4/5 We stayed for 4 nights in the Barkada Room   To breakdown my review: 1. Facility - 4/5 - The place is clean and spacious for the 4 of us. There is hot water available for the shower. There is a bidet in the toilet. Cons for me is that there is no swimming pool in the hotel and bath tub. (though I already knew of this before booking). Also, do not book the barkada room if you have children or elderly. The upper bunk is hard to climb and each movement of the person on top/bottom shakes the whole bed.  2. Service - 5/5 - The staff are kind. Water bottles are provided daily in your room as part of the accommodations. Towels are also changed daily unless you don't want to.   3. Food - 4/5 - Breakfast in hotel is buffet. Consists of Filipino food: Tocino, Corned Beef,//Mike Finn-St. James//This was the second time that we stayed at this hotel and twice we were disappointed with the rooms given even when we had booked our superior rooms months in advance and paid online. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that our room was not available AGAIN and then was told there is only a room with bunk beds?? (Honestly unbelievable it’s not a hostel) I don’t see any point in booking any room at this hotel, it seems it’s first come first served ( Not a way a hotel should be managed). Also the woman receptionist needs more training on how to welcome guests and not look sour faced as if we are not welcome.  Another note too!! If you not up for breakfast at 6 in the morning there will not be a lot left!!//Adrian B//Caja Kitchen - Sir Khennith No Courtesy, asked for help but just instructed me to go to the entrance counter and left. Lack of desire to help and info missing. He's even using his phone while working, watching NBA updates.    Front Desk - Mr. Lindayao I started a small talk, he did not indulge/engage himself; knowing full well that it wasn't even a peak hour for checking in or check out (time check: 4:40ish). He's the same person I talked to over the phone asking if there's a bigger size for the complimentary slippers, but just said that there's none, (monotone) wasn't even bothered to maybe at least explain why there wasn't any available (though I get it since mostly stick to standard filipino size). Also, I felt being profiled by the bellboy (maybe because we came in just by//Johan Munoz//Overall experience is great!  From the front Desk to the Operation Manager are all excellent in doing customer service..  KUDOS to the team for making my stay very comfortable.  I just need to call out the attention of the resto management on their staff who received my call for room service.. she needs improvement in dealing with guest.. bit rude and unapproachable.. talking to her about my OR ( ordered food ) she just shut me off by saying.. "" Di kami nag iisue nyan dito"" - explained to her that yesterday i already had signed some OR.. instead of assisting .. she just told me."" Tanunigin ko na lang sa front desk""  -  very disappointing!    But it was a relief talking to the Operation Manager absorbing all issues and giving me assurance..   still will consider staying here in//Ian//I was so grateful that the hotel extended the lent staycation promo for me.  I stayed there for 2 nights and 3 days. The room was great - so comfy and complete.  I just bothered with the other guests' children who are roaming around and a bit noisy. I am hoping that the staff will properly orient the quests, especially with kids to avoid running, roaming, and making some noise in the hallways.   For the hallways on the 12th floor, since I stayed in a corner-end room, I observed that the floor was not that well-cleaned. And as for the free breakfast, kulang. Good thing there's 7/11 with the hotel's vicinity, I was able to buy food.   Overall, I had a comfy staycation there. Thank you.//@Mikeselaeleventwo//Check in was fast, less than 5 minutes. You'll be provided a complimentary alcohol upon arrival. No queue at all. There are hand sanitizing stations every high touch point/area. Telephone operators are also friendly. Tess stands out with a very accommodating approach and tone of voice. Well done for the manager in charge in front office department. The staffs execute their job efficiently. Therefore, they were guided properly. In addition, breakfast selection is also great! There are food barriers and only the F&B staffs are allowed to distribute the food spread. Good idea👍. All in all, we felt comfortable staying at Bayfront despite of the pandemic.  Thank you Bayfront team! ♥️ Room 609 / March 11-17, 21//BigEarTours//I had a great stay at Bayfront Hotel, Cebu.   The location is very convenient wherein it is about 30 minutes away from the airport, and right across the hotel is the MyBus terminal where this bus is also a convenient transportation service going to and from the airport.   The hotel also has 711 store and ATMS which are very convenient, but if you like to go on a heavy shopping, one of the biggest malls in Cebu is just a minute walk away from the hotel.   The food was delectable and it satisfied my cravings. I recommend their Salisbury steak and their Chicken Cordon Bleu. If you will be having the dinner buffet,  ask them if they have the Bistek Tagalog, which is really good.  Their staff is very accommodating. They always follow the safety protocols, even my dining experience//Emme_Cee_85//Please orient your security guards to be courteous of guests - after all, they are the first ones guests meet. It was my first time to stay and I was unfamiliar with the hotel that i took the wrong entry point going to the hotel. The guard was RUDE and OBNOXIOUS and did not even bother to guide me towards the correct entry point. I had to honk at him loud and tell him help me get out of the exit.  Checking out was also slow.//Car0lyn1022//I love the location of this hotel, which is just across the bus station and a big mall. The facilities are good, and there's also an ATM and 711 store beside it. However, service needs to be improved. They disturbed my sleep by calling me very early in the morning just to ask what breakfast I want? This is truly disappointing for a late sleeper like me! They could have asked during check-in or the night before. Also, I ask to borrow an iron but have to call them again to follow-up and got it after an hour of requesting it! I dont find the front desk staff friendly. She shouted at me to wear my mask in front of many people at the lobby. The only good service I got is they agreed when i ask for a late checkout, which is at 1pm. I really hope they will improve the service because i//Guido//Nice rooms, competent reception staff, frendly. Bad restaurant needs new manager and cook, food is horrible.A good reataurant would help boost occupancies in time of Covide19. I dont want to return as long....//BibiX//I did enjoy my stay in Bayfront Hotel Cebu. Edmerick/Edmer the front office desk, he’s the best! I felt his connection with his guests the way he accommodates us, you will feel that you’re truly welcome in Bayfront Hotel.   Also, Loren or Loraine and Austin did a respectable job in assisting their guests. In my experience, it was one of the best hotel stays in Cebu.   Regardless of the small hotel issues I have, the management still handled my concerns well. I highly recommend it!//Mamer N//i love the location , its across sm city cebu you can walk to it. the room is spacious , upkeep is not the best though, it feels like a bit rundown already considering its quite a new hotel. buffet was good and the hotel staff were friendly and accommodating. i love the fact they have in house spa, we had room service massage three times during our stay.//David W//Stayed for the 6th time in 2Y in this hotel. Price vs quality correct,  old rooms with smelly carpets but spacious and big bathroom with a bathtub. You need to unplug the night light to connect your phone charger to a plug. But the hotel has an outstanding security and an outstanding breakfast buffet. Checkin and checkout is super slow but all staff is super friendly and well trained.  Yes, a hotel with contradictions but I return to this wonderful hotel each time I come to Cebu.",,,,,,

The hotel is also friendly for the senior citizens and persons with disability. The menu are good also. First timers will be definitely satisfied with the overall services of summit galleria hotel.\\Odyssey56047745898\\From the lobby, cafe summit, hallway and the hotel room- aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. Sophisticated and elegant but reasonably priced hotel.   Big room, clean, spacious, well lighted with modern design/theme. Although, bathroom fixtures maybe improved.   Breakfast offering/selection was above average. I felt the food was prepared with love because they were all tasty. The ham with mango glazed and spanish style bangus were delicious. The cafe ambience is class and relaxing and may I say comforting, as there is a positive feeling evoked to start the day.  Beth is attentive but not intruding. Her smile is warm, shy but sincere.   A pleasant stay indeed.\\Chris R\\We had our meal at cafe summit and the service was amazing. We are thankful for Jun for catering to our needs especially since we were dining with our little kids.

For the past 6 years every time I traveled to Robinsons Galleria Cebu for shopping, dining, and watching movies, I already have Summit Hotels and Resorts on my bucket list. When the pandemic broke up, with strict health protocols to follow, it was hard to travel abroad. From then on, I've decided to be a local tourist guest of my own City/Province and experience Cebuano hospitality to help the tourism industry which is badly affected.  When I was browsing were to celebrate the Chinese New Year 2022 to welcome the Year of the Water Tiger,  Summit Galleria Cebu suddenly popped up online and days after, as a pageant fan, the Philippines won the\\Torch 3\\Stayed 3 nights here. Clean and comfy beds. Good AC, right water  pressure and heater is operational despite the City was impacted by super typhoon Odette where Metro Cebu has NO power and water in many areas.

Each floor has complimentary water dispenserin the hallways. Nice staff. Would recommend.\\Miyang\\So I had my quarantine with this Hotel.  All I can say is the customer service is highly appreciated, since the day I arrived until I checked out.  If I request something they immediately have an action.

Hardworking and approachable!  For all the staffs, thank you! Salamat!\\Lc\\Superb! Had a safe, clean, and warm stay. Staff made sure to look after the cleanliness of the room a day after the beginning of the stay. Will be sure to come and will definitely try their restaurant.\\Owen McBride\\A great clean hotel with a great staff. Helpful from the time we arrived on the doorstep until we checked out. A great experience. The hotel is perfectly located adjoined to the Robinson's Galleria Mall. A very short distance away (visible in the distance) SM City, Cebu. Very very close to Pier 1 and all fast craft. The staff were very accommodating to our needs for storage space due to a variety of over-sized Balikbayan boxes. The doormen were most helpful in ""flagging"" taxis. And the PNP on the premises were a very comforting thought. The room was pristine with a great view. Thanks to the entire staff. I am looking forward to staying there again in the future.\\Ghilord baguio\\This hotel is the best in term of cleanliness and ambiance and also the location itself close to malls,churches, and Port. I did my hotel quarantine for 10 days in Summit Galleria Cebu ,my room are big with dinning area,living area, big sleeping room and Big Comfort Room, crew and staff are friendly  they are well trained about protocols and guidelines .. good job\\Ron\\I stayed here for 8 nights to quarantine as a Returning Overseas Filipino (ROI). While I cannot fault the courtesy of the staff, the food was a major letdown.  I would give better meals to the homeless on the streets. Not once during the whole stay did they serve a fruit with the meals. If you want to eat healthy and stay sane while stuck in the hotel room, I suggest that you download Food Panda on your phone and get food delivered to you from your choice of restaurants. Otherwise, the whole experience could make you feel like you are paying to stay in a fancy hotel to eat a prisoner's food. It was depressing. I did not mind eating from a disposable plate with plastic spoon and fork if this is for health reasons, but I believe that a balanced meal is essential to a person's well\\IMGlobal77749\\the hotel has excellent customer service. they respond to inquiries, concerns and request immediately. they are very accommodating. I just wish they serve better food. for a 3 day quarantine, our hotel bill is a package with 3 meals a day. but it was very small servings. for the price paid, it should have been more, with more selection and servings. apart from food, i think the hotel is good. just a little pricey compared to others. the airport to hotel transpo should also be free and included in the reservation. but they charge every single activity.\\Francis\\they have a large room, a family of three is well accommodated. the staff are very polite and friendly, the food was great as well. place is very clean and comfy. didn't had the chance to visit the pool though. internet is fast but it sometimes get disconnected.\\Mark D\\not our first time here. and not our last Pool is great Limited menu due to pandemic, yet they tried their best to accommodate... not totally disappointed  Staff makes or breaks a property Staff here is world class, above average accommodating, concerned and attentive. Very very enjoyable stay and we will go again soon\\Glenn Guinto\\The location is excellent. The room is clean. However, the Internet is really slow it's totally unusable. I used mobile data so I could work.. :(  Hot shower is not working in our room.. :( I think the shower and toilet's glass doors should swing inward, instead of outward as it blocks passage and could bump into each other.  Our booking includes ""free breakfast."" Well, it's not really free since you can book without breakfast for a cheaper price.  You don't get to choose the type of breakfast. 1st day, sausage, scrambled eggs, and rice. 2nd day, tocino, scrambled eggs and rice.  3rd day, repeat 1st day :D sausage, scrambled eggs and rice. No offence meant, but their ""free"" breakfast reminds us of the meals served in inter-island passenger/ferry ships :D To their credit, they\\Eunice Gail O\\Our stay was amazing. A good getaway from a work day.   The room was very spacious and clean. The bed waaaaaas aaaaaaawesooooooome! It was big and so comfortable. Also the room lighting and color were very pleasant to see. To add, the block out curtains are really good. ☺️\\steph_dmd\\I can attest to the great service of the banquet staff, delightful food and fabulous function hall. So thankful for Ms. Stephany Cañete for accommodating our event last sept.17 in spite this coronavirus pandemic. Our event was a success big thanks to summit staff and crews. More power to all! May you continue to fulfill and bring happiness to all that needs your services.\\aguitongleoniza\\I had a very pleasant stay with great accommodations.  Room was big and comfortable.  People were kind and always smiling.  The front desk lady was also very helpful getting a grab car en route to the airport upon checking out.\\Ricardo\\I had an enjoyable stay at the Summit Hotel because the staff are helpful, the food is good, rooms are clean and comfortable and beside a mall. I have been a guest of this hotel for several times but my last stay was the most memorable one. I have reserved in Summit Circle but was was on my mind was Galleria but although I had no reservation they accommodated me instantly. Also I forgot my cellphone charger but they have a spare charger on the front desk so I was able to charge my phone. Thanks to that..\\kiietiu\\Naiwan ko yung pera ko sa may table dun sa room , nung tinawagan ko sila nahanap nila yung pera tapos pinakuha ko nalang sa pinsan ko. Thank you so much po , highly recommended, minsan nalang yung ganyan.\\Roman III Reyes\\It's very close to my Cebu office so I stay here whenever I am in Cebu (which is about 2 weeks out of every month). Convenient because it sits atop a mall where there's an abundance of choices for meals and shopping . The mall's quite new too and has a good variety of shops for almost all your needs. The breakfast buffet is excellent also. Each room has its own WiFi router so you get a good signal all the time.  What's not so good? Really small ref in the room, and only 4 clothes hangers (they don't expect you to stay too long I guess)...\\r0mmelreyes\\i always stay at the summit  galleria every time i travel to cebu which is a weeklong stay every 2 weeks. i like its convenience to my place of work and the amenities it offers especially the shops in the mall below where i can dine and buy items i suddenly need. the breakfast buffet is also excellent.\\stiflerspeilberg\\We stayed only 1 night but the customer service was the highlight... They were so kind and helpful from the moment we got out from our van until we left... Although, there was only 1 elevator working at that time, I understood the inconvenience because they were preparing for the sinulog festival... I love that the mall is just right there... You can eat, shop anytime... i wish we could’ve stayed there for more days... Definitely one of our choices to stay in Cebu!\\Giusseppe S\\We got to the hotel at least an hour earlier than check in time but the receptionist did not make it difficult for us. she made arrangements so we could deposit our luggage at their luggage storage. Then asked us if we can allow a couple of minutes so they can check if they can allow us to check in earlier than expected. So my fiance and I just decided to grab a quick bite at the mall. Of which to my surprise, the hotel had access to where we need not go out as it was scorching hot out. After a sumptuous lunch, we can back to the hotel and our room was already ready. The room was really clean and the aircon was cold. Checking out was also a breeze.Too bad we only had time in our schedule for a one nightstay. But I would definitely be back if ever I am in the area.",,,,,,

Particularly, one male concierge was excellent. I remember his name, DOLF, I would like to comment how I pleased was with the service given by him. He is the best concierge ever. I really made my day thanks to him. Many thanks.\\Michael J\\It used to be good but since Covid it has gone downhill. The rooms are getting tired, the lobby needs work, the staff need better training and it needs new management and an investment. Last time I stayed I had a cold shower for 5 days straight even though every day I was told it had been fixed. Management is obviously very poor and this shows. I have stayed there 12 times but never again.\\Czar Emmanuel\\While this remains as one of the well-known hotels in Cebu City, particularly in Lahug area, it is clearly old and needs renovation. The ground floor is okay, with very few but nice shops and restaurants, but the upper floors, especially the rooms, show clear signs of deterioration. The carpets were stained, some furniture's upholstery was also old, the headboard of my bed had some torn canvass, some parts of the lampshade were peeling off, etc. WIFI was also weak, and the conference rooms were not soundproof. We had a three-day function in one of the conference rooms on the second floor and we could hear all the noises coming from the other conference rooms. The swimming pool and the gym were small. The elevators were very slow. Lastly, the menu of the restaurant near the lobby\\Rodel of Betterman Tours Bohol\\Approachable Front officers, big parking, huge massive lobby, Hotel location is at its best. Near and even walking distance to IT park where you can find more dining places. Not far from Malls. Nice to held and event with big function halls and breakfast is a must.\\LKJE\\We stayed here for the for the first time four years ago and I loved it. This time we used it as a base in cebu  for a 4 week tour. It fell short unfortunately. It is looking a little tired  now, the pool area has a derelict waterfall that is taped off, the rooms are hit and miss in quality too. One night we stayed in 1411  and it wasn't until we were on our way to Danao port my wife said I was bitten all night by something, were you?. Er, no!!. And if I was I wouldn't have stayed in the bed. I'm not saying there were bed bugs in our bed but only when she sprayed her legs in 50% deet did it stop. Final day we stayed we didn't get a room until 16.15 having arrived from the camotes island at 13.00. Shame as I really liked this place. The only people getting booked in were ones for\\WombatAussie\\We regularly stay here because of the great price, service, and fantastic breakfast. But we can highly recommend the buffet dinner too. We had a small complaint that there were none of their fantastic muffins for breakfast and to our surprise we found a box of muffins was delivered to our room -  this says that they know that ""little things can mean a lot"".\\Nathalie N\\Not impressed with this hotel. Would not return. I did a last minute, literally booked this the day before, trip to Cebu. Not much hotel availability anymore at that time so I picked this one. I figured a 4 star rated hotel with a casino and nice pics should be nice. I was not a fan of this hotel, and I don’t need much fancy at all. Upon arrival, the lobby is huge and looks nice, but it was smelly. It was very clean but the smell didn’t want me stay in the area at all.  The room was just ok. The bed wasn’t very comfortable, but ok.  The bathroom appliances were old and my shower pull bottom from switching from bath tub mode to shower mode was stuck so I only got have the water shower. I didn’t bother asking for new room or getting this fixed. I made due.  Casino was boring. Lots\\RaSha\\I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in May 2023. It was a good stay. Rooms are reasonable in size for a four star hotel. Buffet breakfast was OK , the choices average. Staff were polite and helpful. Centrally located. I would be happy to recommend this hoel.\\Rinku P\\Stayed in for 1 night. They don’t live up to their brand.  - Checkin experience was average. They had only 3 desks open for checkin. Resulting in people standing in queue for more than 15mins.  - Pool area definitely needs maintenance. Broken chairs, chipped tiles, slippery areas.  - Bar at the pool - Don’t come with any expectations. Only selective beer available. No cocktails or wine by the pool.  - Drinks inside the hotel - strictly ok. Again very few options.  - Restaurants- they have several restaurants serving different cuisines like Italian, Japanese, Chinese etc. Being a vegetarian (no meat no fish) we wanted buffet option. There was nothing that we could use except bread. So we ended up eating Italian. Quality not upto mark with price and hotel name. Breakfast buffet\\Claudia D\\The shower was third world, dated and dirty room. I booked the wrong waterfront hotel. I meant to book the one across from the airport and booked downtown instead, try to change booking, spoke to a very rude registration person called Leti asked for manager she said manager was on vacation. The place is pricey and a hell hole\\Jonathan\\We recently spent three nights at the Waterfront while conducting some business at the US Consulate located downstairs.  Despite the limitations imposed by the pandemic,  we found the food and staff service to be first rate. They are striving to provide a guest experience that is as stress free as possible under all the circumstances.  I salute the staff and management for their excellence!\\Albert Chan Paran\\Waterfront Cebu City Hotel and Casino is a 4 star hotel located within easy reach of key business, commercial and shopping districts of the Queen City of the South with 561 well appointed luxurious guest rooms and suites, which includes 13 Ambassador Rooms, 10 Ambassador Suites, and 1 Penthouse Suite. It has a huge casino, 10 restaurants and bars/lounge, full service spa, wide outdoor pool, health club, conference center, branded shops, daily housekeeping and 2 grand ballrooms perfect venue for shows, concerts, and events. Truly a stunning landmark and great City landscape at the beating heart of Cebu City.  Time and time again, every time I gaze at the structure of this hotel from the City's thoroughfare, it reminded me of the famous Disneyland Castle and it made me smile by\\charl0ttestuck\\Air conditioning was a problem which made us move rooms several times. Placement of curtains in the shower was not well thought of because water would still soak the bathroom floor even if the curtain was properly closed. I would call room service or housekeeping and even operator several times and they wouldnt pick up.\\tundagkent19\\Food was very good and we will always come back for that. The managaer was very generous to upgrade our room since the aircon was not functioning well. But, the pool attendant was kinda rude and some food servers are kinda unattentive. But overall it was very good.\\j0celynbustamante\\Any business or establishments defined on their excellent customer service. Customers are loyal because the best experienced they received, and I am one of those customers. The values and the frontline team members made the Waterfront the best place to stay in Cebu.\\Coachjugz\\I love the fact that the hotel and the staff is vmchild friendly. I didnt even have to ask for a bowl of cereal for my child. The room is big and spacious and clean. I would love to come back for another staycation with my family one day.\\mysteriousdebz\\This was just an overnight staycation... Staff was accommodating and breakfast was good! however, wifi and tv cable were intermittent... other than that, everything was good. i highly recommend this hotel...\\Rhonareta\\I rate it excellent because the services were all good. From security, front desk, food and etc. If given a chance to recommend a hotel to anyone who like to travel. I would gladly recommend this hotel.\\jeancoke21\\awesome and very convenient place to stay in... due to pandemic they don’t have buffet so they serve breakfast set at a very low cost and love their American style meal set. Recommended place to stay in the city.\\jaysontipontipon\\Room reservations, amenities, and all are EXCELLENT. My stay in Waterfront was very worthwhile and noteworthy. If I will be given the chance to choose a hotel to stay in the future, I will always choose Waterfront. But there's one thing that I weren't that satisfied, there was this one young lady who was one of those who serve our snacks that was so moody when serving. Other than that, everything is excellent. Thank you for the accomodation, Waterfront, Lahud Branch!\\Perry B\\We had a good time at this establishment and found it comfortable and well serviced. The staff were very pleasant. The swimming pool was the perfect place to retreat to amid the  mid autumn warm weather last year. It was a particularly good one!\\Daphne\\Due to the Pandemic our company let us stay here for a couple of days to prevent us from getting infected since i live far from my office. All of their staff has a pleasing personality.. From the gardener, security, receptionist, buffet area..and even their chefs..  amidst the crisis, you can still see them smiling and addresses your concern in a pleasant way..   Thank you for your service...\\Persephone\\For so many reasons... Room rate P5k 1 No bidet - reported on the first day. I was told that all standard rooms don’t have bidet. Guess what? My friend is in a standard room with bidet. I was then told that not all rooms have bidet. Yung totoo? 2 Slowest internet connection any time of the day or night. 7mbps download, 2mbps upload. I started watching an hour film around 1AM. I’m still on 00:53 at 4:53AM. Lol 3 AC issues - also reported on the first day and we’re already on our 10th day. I did multiple follow-ups but they simply don’t care.  4 Power plugs and or sockets are far from where it should be. Don’t expect to use your phones while lying down and charging. Or bring your own extension wires if you still want to check in here.  5 Food...insanely expensive, mediocre taste.\\kwagatsuma1121\\i tried to book a 2nd night from your hotel internet sight directly, but it was impossible because of credit card authority. i could book from Expedia by same card. i think there is some trouble in your sight.\\marvinbernardino2020\\Your hotel is highly recommended to other persons/travelers who want to stay and experience the beauty of CEBU. Thank you for the good service and Delicious foods (Breakfast Buffet). Have a Blessed Sunday Morning :)\\Glicel Ann P\\The staff is very friendly, helpful and professional. In the heart of Cebu city and near IT Park, this is a lovely hotel. I love the colonial feel to it. The room are spacious with good facilities. The hotel has a lot of places to eat. I will never forget that i saw one of the most famous artist in ABS-CBN, Ian veneracion, Vina Morales and Morissette. I was so happy that time. And now i know that this hotel has a lot of artist to go there.\\Ronnel C\\Great atmosphere, several nice onsite restaurants to choose from, good breakfast buffet no matter where your from they have something for you. Rooms were very nice, I had the executive suite. Hotel staff was very helpful. Almost everything you need in one place. Close to the Ayala mall, and the in hotel stores were nice as well.\\Roel\\From Mactan Cebu International Airport, tell the taxi driver to drop you off at Waterfront Cebu City Hotel and Casino in Lahug , about a 35-minute drive and conveniently located across Cebu’s IT Hub, the Asiatown IT Park. The hotel is also just ten minutes away from the premier shopping malls and hottest lifestyle destinations.  The waterfront hotel is very comfortable and also the employees is approachable and kind. Soon I’ll be back here.\\Farrah G\\We were there just for an overnight layover. We are very pleased as we were upgraded to the Ambassador Suite for free. Amenities are a bit dated but still very clean. We were hoping to use the pool but it was a bit crowded that time of year.\\Adam S\\Some good (if pricey) restaurants to choose from with good food. The lobby looks great and the ambient music from live performers is a nice touch, though the saxophonists especially were pretty pitchy.   Some general requests which were outside the norm resulted in some quite intensive questioning by the staff (for instance my wife just wanted a slice of bread without anything on it, and iii took a good 5 minutes for the staff to understand this) and the staff weren't particularly attentive in the lobby lounge, but in general the place was fine.   It's not particularly close to anything except IT Park, be prepared for a lot of traffic to and from the airport.",,,,,,

When I walked into Raddision on Tues 5 Sept I felt very good with the elegant and tasteful  interior design. Even the Filipino Ikebana stle flower arrangements everywhere.  I was particularly impressed with the restaurant super service-oriented attention and courtesy.  Paricularky how you trained tour restaurant service staff to be sooo good.  I dropped my breakfast even though out of 4 days I enjoyed 1 day of breakfast as I was very busy with business and leisuure easure eg whale sharks and waterfalls.  Half way my breakfast I wanted to give very good reviews & hence this very long reviews.   If I put excellent '5' peoe tend to think they are so good\\Otis_Jan\\Nothing else to say but amazing place to stay, hospitality is top notch and the service beyond expectation. The staffs were amazing, and the hotel is gorgeous. Loving the live music entertainment in the evening in the bar too, that was a bonus.\\I❤️banff\\We stayed here for 4D/3N. The king bed was gigantic and very comfortable. The room was very clean. I personally picked this hotel for 2 main reason: 1. SM city is just next to the hotel. 2. I don’t want to ride a cab to take us shopping . Very accessible indeed to buy all your pasalubongs. We stayed here after our 3 1/2 week’s vacation mostly within the Visayas Islands.   We wanted to be well rested before our international flight.  We enjoyed our complimentary drinks while listening to the live music playing in the lobby/bar. Night swimming was also fun with our youngest.  Perfect to end the night. We heard the breakfast buffet was the best but we opt out coz we prefer to sleep in. We made reservations for dinner buffet instead and we were not disappointed, well except for the\\dmills332\\Central location for me, as I go to the office and other locations in Cebu and Mactan. I find having SM Mall next door super handy. The staff are always on hand to help out with requests, finding transpo etc.\\Anthony Huang\\Breakfast was delicious many choices but no mangoes in the fruit section.Theresa receptionist is attentive, entertaining and knowledgeable.She is a huge asset to your restaurant. We will definitely be back soon.   A fantastic experience and highly recommended.\\Johntxspud\\Hotel location was great. The location of the room given was next to the elevator foyer where we heard the constant elevator bells and people chatting. Some event had some heavy base that vibrated all the way up to the 14th floor from 8 pm to 6 am.\\JoeyBoyCalifornia\\This hotel sets the standards for all other hotels to aim for.  Clean, safe and have staff that are simply amazing.  Every encounter was pleasant and professional. The staff truly WANT to help their guests.  This is one of the best aspects of the Radisson Blu.  The staff want the guests to be comfortable and to have a pleasant stay; They will literally bend over backwards to make it the best experience.\\iowaloves2travel\\A very nice hotel. The room had a nice desk and they were able to get me an adaptor for my usa laptop. The restaurant had many options for both breakfast and lunch. The bed was firm and the pillows were soft. My room had a walk in shower. The room was musty smelling would be the only downside. The hotel is right next to the mall very easy to walk across the street.\\Ann Carmel M\\Stayed and dined and is always a wonderful experience.

The food was fantastic, with even small touches like vegemite on offer for the Aussie guests. Well done!\\Compass56053400368\\The front desk and restaurant staff are great and friendly. Supposed to have an amazing stay BUT when we checked out the concierge did not assist in opening the door to the exit seeing that I had heavy bags in both hands.\\stevewestcliff\\Great stay and marvellous hotel. Great staff and nice pool. The only issue were the bed sheets were a little itchy but maybe over starched as they were so clean. The pool was lovely and the room attendant amazing. The check in staff brilliant.\\Densyorn27\\The experience that my family had in staying at the Radisson Blu hotel was phenomenal. The facility is clean and top notched and the staff is was beyond exceptional. In my opinion, you get the best value at the best location in Cebu City.

Bartenders are so approachable in very  good way they offer good drinks . Place are very nice to hung out highly recommeded .. we are enjoy while staying here.\\18_NorthStar_94\\There’s few things: 1.) Upon booking, they charge local tax and estimated tax after you placed the credit details for booking confirmation  2.) Upon checkin, they let you wait 45mins in the queue 3.) WHEN ITS YOUR TURN, they will tell yoy, there’s no room available  4.) They then let you wait 1hr and 45 mins for yoy to go in. 5.) Pillows were bad.\\Passport39226059828\\Walking through the lobby I was immediately impressed. The service at the front desk was very professional and the room i was given was very comfortable. The food at the buffet everyday was always excellent.\\KritzR3\\Recommendations:  Provide ‘do not disturb’ door knob hanger for guests privacy concerns. Additional daily unique dish for breakfast buffet, with consideration for guest with multiple night stay at the hotel.\\malianfa\\I love my short stay in your hotel and I enjoyed your amazing service. Your personnel are courteous and hospitable. The rate of your hotel is affordable and your ammenities are excellent. Your facilities are well maintained by your hardwoking staff.\\Mirasol M\\Grace Salazar highly recommended us to stay at Radisson Blu. The service was excellent, Girlie took control of our booking and accommodated all our needs in our room. And then Alexine at the buffet treated us like royalty where she surprised us with fruit and a cake in honor of celebrating my husband’s retirement! I highly recommend Radisson to anyone that is staying or visiting Cebu Philippines. Amenities and customer service was outstanding!\\larryhockaday1984\\Customer service was amazing. I stayed for 3 weeks and had no problems. The mall was across the street. Security was friendly and I felt safe. The pool bar employees remember my orders and engaged in small talk.\\michael m\\I cannot praise Radisson Hotel enough for their remarkable dining experience. The food options were diverse, and each dish was crafted with precision and creativity. The flavors were exquisite, and the presentation was a feast for the eyes. The hotel's commitment to exceptional service was epitomized by Kyle, whose attentiveness and friendly demeanor left a lasting impression. Not only that but also Fhel, Jean (reception) for her genuine passion for hospitality and dedication to ensuring guests' satisfaction added an extra layer of enjoyment to my dining experience",,,,,,

Also when you are on a long stay in a hotel it is a big test\\alwaystravelsf\\Not a High End Luxury hotel but almost there!  The positive is it’s very clean, quality of finishes very polished and staff excellent and friendly!  Also the location is great as it’s connected to the Ayala Central Block mall.  Lots of restaurants/bars nearby and also Sugbo Mercado.  Room was great and had the 1 bdr apartment which very affordable.   On the negative side is the on-site restaurant breakfast buffet is not good imo.  Many items had run out and not replaced, food isn’t cooked very well and mostly cold.  Many guests will open the holding container and leave open.  Also egg station specialty is eggs sunny side up but they’re always cold even after they just make them.    Swimming pool adequate but kinda small it’s on roof.  So understandable, gym very small, can hear\\jayford l\\We stayed at Seda IT Park for vacation and I really had fun during our stay. Everything is accessible from malls to food park. Staffs are great and warmth welcoming especially Nathan who assisted us from check-in and check-out. He gave us a very nice IT Park view and a complimentary drink at the bar. Thank you Nathan and to all the friendly staff! We'll surely be back this year for my grandma's birthday.\\Adventure47542725541\\Great people and very friendly.  At the bar I met Emil and he doing very good Job and also at the Miso buffet resto, I met Kingswel he entertain really well , friendly and hard working. Over all , all staff is doing great. Also i can see ,The lady manager , she was doing very good job for helping her staff at the Miso Resto.\\Bby L\\the nightly fare is well rewarded with a fantastic experience. this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in anywhere. Everything except the pool deck are wonderful. Unfortunately the tiles used at the pool washroom entrance are very slippery. Why hasn't the hotel removed and replaced them? I slipped, and the guard said, we have already told management about the inappropriate tiles. so, you know about this. Change the tiles. It is not a big job.\\Clair D\\Everything is great and very accessible to malls and park. Me and my colleagues would surely choose it again next time we visit Seda. Thanks to Nathan, for your accommodating and helping us through your services.\\Michiko N\\Stayed with my auntie for two nights in a two bedroom, and our stay was great! the service was awesome! Our room was supposed to come with a washer and dryer but only came with a dryer, so they offered us complimentary laundry service. One of the servers was exceptional and incredible with his service (thanks Kingswell!) and he made our breakfast time super enjoyable! Great food too!! Loved everything about our stay!\\Curious17005830904\\Superb inn. Excellent service the room was big, clean, and had everything we needed. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious; The buffet had a very large selection. I had the opportunity to speak with the telephone operators at night because I was having a bad day. They were extremely accommodating and friendly, and I would like to commend them for their excellent service. I believe their names are Diana, Kyla, and Kiara. The location is excellent! right adjacent to the shopping center and I would recommend this hotel to my friends.  Seda, thank you!\\Godxxx01\\This place is great.  The people are really helpful BUT i find it a bit strange to put 2 trainees just standing the whole day by the entrance to greet the hotel guests.  I find it a bit inhumane. I think their talent be use better by really training them. We got an upgrade with a stunning view of city. Not just a room but a BIG 1-bedroom APARTMENT with a functioning washing machine and separate dryer.   The pool was great on the rooftop but the bar is being built, that was a bummer.  I checked our the roof top bar in the evening.  Nice view and vibes and good offers to choice.  Unfortately, it closed really early at  midnight. Highly recommended in the middle of the new spot in Cebu city, the IT PARK with great going out scene and never sleeps due to the overwhelming presence of\\John Alexander Q\\The building feels very brand new. I got a one-bedroom and it was well laid out. The view from the room was also nice. My room had a kitchenette, dining table, couch, and lots of space.   If you are renting a car with driver or have your own car, the parking area exit is next to the drop-off point, so there is really not much wait for your pick-up.  Breakfast was a let down, it was purely Filipino and nothing great. This needs real menu improvement.  Overall I had a great stay.\\RamonStinges\\It’s a relatively new hotel but its rooms are already deteriorating. Cleanliness is not what I expected and had 3 cockroaches in my room. Staff is not very engaging and take all the complaints and suggestions for granted, as if they are you used to it hearing the same thing over and over again. The only highlights are location and breakfast.\\Galasheeng S\\We had a great stay in here comfy and cozy. Commend to Ritchell and Frances for assisting us during check in and transfer of room for my mom and sis. And also to Jomalie for attending to us during our breakfast. Thank you everyone.\\CMarie L\\We stayed at Seda Central Bloc for at least a month and experienced the best of the best! Everyone was so helpful and nice. Service with a smile! My sister and myself now know that there is nowhere else best to stay but here.  Their apartment style rooms equipped with washer and dryer was a great perk. Rooms were clean always and food was great!   But what was best of all? The people that worked there.. Razel, Kingswell, Nelson, Charlie, etc (there are  so many other names and please forgive me if I have missed mentioning them as my old age memory has caught on :-) )- —we came to know most of them and their impeccable service. From the Bellman, to their front desk, the housekeeping and to the breakfast team! Thank you! Thank you!! Thank you! For making us feel so at home! A home\\Ellery\\As a person with Autism traveling with a dad with physical disability and a senior mom, I have nothing but praises for this hotel. From the moment we got picked up at the airport on 01/27/23, I knew that we would be in great hands. Both gentlemen refused to let us lift a finger. Upon arrival at the hotel & seeing where it’s located ( in Cebu’s I.T. Park), I felt that the location was bang on. When we arrived, the security welcomed us and a bellman acted in seamless haste making us feel like royalty. We wede guided to the 5th floor where the hotel lobby is actually at. Julie of the Front Desk team and every single person of that team during our entire 6 night/7 day stay were not only professional but also very kind. We were given suite 702, my parents 903, my sister and her\\michaelciel\\Wow what a fantastic hotel, located in IT park.  We stayed for a month in a two bedroom apartment and could not have been happier. The apartment comes with two bathrooms, lounge, dining room and kitchen. Expert daily housekeeping by a friendly and efficient team of attendants.  Daily breakfast buffet is first class with local delicacies along with all the western favourites. Great value lunch and dinner buffets along with al a carte menu and because you are in the heart of the city you have 24 hour restaurants along with fast food that you can venture out for have delivered. Loved the bar on the top floor with nightly entertainment along with tasty food and delicious cocktails and a good wine list.  Direct access to shopping centre and supermarket.  Last but most importantly the\\Mykie Louise P\\Our stay at Seda IT Park was by far the best staycation we ever had. WHY?  The room: Surpassed our expectations. It had everything we needed, specially the kitchen. What we saw live was even better than the pics online. We give it a full-on 10!  The staff: They were truly wonderful! From check-in, to renting the hotel vehicle, to breakfast buffets, to room service, uuuup until we checked out, certified: NO HASSLE! SMOOTHE STAY. We thank Frances Marionne from the front desk, and Rachel from the breakfast buffet, the guy who drove us to the airport, and to the wonderful staff that gave us great service, KUDOS!  Will choose SEDA IT Park again for another great stay in Cebu, thanks!\\Gio A\\Posting this to help in the fight against diseases especially covid-19. Cleanliness/Housekeeping in this hotel is very bad. We feel unsafe when it comes to cleanliness/health and anti-covid19 standards.   Upon checkin: 1.) Toilet bowl lid is very dirty with urine probably from previous guest. We called for a cleaner right away. Questionable anti-covid19 standards!!  2.) Lots of small moths flying inside the room!  During the night: 3.) We noticed blood stains on one of the pillows. Yuck!  And btw, do you really not have hand towel available in the room? Or forgotten again by your questionable housekeeping/cleaning team? Even cheap hotels have one.   Urine, blood, and flying insects are not acceptable. Please help fight against covid-19. Hope you improve.\\Rhon Adam L\\While I was walking on the aisle of the restaurant, a man named Felipe approached me with a pleasing appearance that makes my conscience wants to dine in. I thank Felipe for being an extraordinary attendant to me and satisfy my cravings.\\Enlyy\\Stayed for 3 weeks.  2 weeks in One bedroom apartment. It was big and comfortable. Also in the room, there is washing machine and dryer.  1 week in Deluxe room. Cozy and comfortable.  Buffet is also nice, service is good too. Thank you\\A O\\One, if not THE best, hotel in Cebu we’ve  been to so far. Location is good with easy access to the mall, suite room has good lay out, clean & perfect for family. The swimming pool deck had great view , breakfast buffet was great (lots of choices!)  with good view outside the window.  Staff were professional and attentive to guests. The 3 bedroom suite was so worth it with its amenities and location. We had a great time despite the rainy weather we had that day.\\Louieboytoy\\5 star for me!  Seda never fails! Ive been to Seda Nuvali for several times and Seda Cebu is equally impressive!  Staff are friendly! Amenities ✔️ Location is just walking distance to the malls and my office ✔️ Room is very spacious  What they can improve on is their room wifi as it often disconnects.  But over-all, I will surely be back!\\Jen D\\Had the best stay ever at this hotel. Customer service over all is outstanding.    Everyone has been very pleasant, courteous and always ready to help.  Special shoutout to the F&B team, Rose - manager, Francis - supervisor, and the rest of the staff especially Razel.   They have quite a spread for their breakfast buffet and food is tasty but they can add a little bit of variety every now and then. 😊  Room is very clean and cozy.  You get cleaning service every day of the week.  They're generous with their bottled water service (comes free with your room reservation) unlike some hotels where they scrimp on this service.    I would definitely be back here.  😊\\Inna Marie S\\Seda hotel is one of my favorite staycation hotel to go to in Cebu. Aside from being so accessible, the staff here was so nice & very friendly esp. Nathan who happily assisted me during my check in & Wengie who assisted us during our visit to the straight up bar. Very much appreciated! The food here is also superb & if you want to have a chill night with your friends they have a perfect place for that! I really got to relax after my long week of work, a prefect Staycation indeed! Highly recommend! Thank you Seda & I will definitely be back!\\Angelica\\Highly recommended hotel very accessible, amaze how clean and spacious their room, the staff are very friendly. The foods are delicious i would like to thank wengie for accomodating us in straight up bar. We really enjoyed our stay at seda. Thank you also to nathan for the smooth check in eventhough we are late in our check in time. We will surely back!\\Jelord Godrim\\The room are clean and nice, I really love the view in the pool and also the food and drinks in the bar very good and tasty especially in the buffet . The location was very accessible and would like to give a special thanks to Nathan and Wengie for giving their best accomodation for our stay never been accomadated that way before really love it very friendly. Will be probably book another stay soon.\\SCQ\\I've stayed in many Seda hotels before. They're good but still had minor hiccups. Seda Central Bloc,however, beats them all out in terms of hospitality and efficiency. It may not be the biggest and fanciest among all, but it is the best for me.  Check-in was supposed to be at 2:00PM but since our room was already ready, front desk officer Ritchelle let us have an early check-in at 12:00 noon free of charge. On top of this, she was very warm, friendly, and she even remembered me on my last day. Front desk officer Nathan was also very helpful. I had some minor requests and he  gladly asissted me. Housekeeping was also very efficient. Went out for 2+ hours and when we came back our room was already made up. Lastly, check-out was such a breeze. Props to Loren for this. It was the\\Journey217504\\Washer and dryer need I say more?  It’s perfectly located next to Ayala Mall, Starbucks Reserve is within walking distance.  Gym is decent for a good workout, pool nice both located on the 17th floor with an amazing view of the city!!! Everyone at the hotel eager to always help.\\Royce A\\Great city view. Room size is above average meaning bigger than other deluxe Seda rooms we’ve been to.  Misto resto is with a great view but it can be easily get full and refill takes time especially the bacon.   There is direct access to the Mall which is a good thing however there is not much yet in the Central Block Mall but the basics are there.  It could have been 5 star if not for the front desk who called in the middle of the night 10:30pm. They interrupted our sleep for a mistake.  We were asleep when they called to ask if we’re done with the iron and board which we previously requested but declined because there was no available.  Other than that, it was a great 2N/3D. We’ll comeback when in town.\\mmvelasquez\\Location is great, mall restaurants very safe. Very clean and everyone is very nice. Breakfast buffet is very bad nothing at the right temperature, made to order eggs are just eggs pre made sitting under a heat lamp. When asked for fresh made to order eggs they refused to do so. Pork products not cooked thoroughly or very fresh. One morning bugs in cheese. Needless to say they need better management of breakfast buffet from the kitchen out.\\Clow\\This is actually the second time I’ve stayed in this hotel, and both times the experience was well spent. The room was very clean and spacious. The staff are very friendly. The breakfast buffet was what I was looking forward to the most. Highly recommended and I will definitely visit again.",,,,,,

The Room and room service are great. will definitely come back for business and personal stay. Will also recommend to my family and friends.\\seoym0826\\it was lovely staying and what I like the most is responsiveness of all the staff and kindness. I 'll definitely stay at seda again. breakfast was good.  it felt secured each time security guard at the gate checked whenever I entered.\\rmbagsik\\Seda did not disappoint. Location is ideal and accessible to the mall and public transport. Restaurant staff and Front of House team are very helpful and friendly. The cleaning crew is thorough.  Overall - will definitely back once we visit Cebu city again.\\pallegumaraojr\\We arrived past 10pm and our room was still reserved for us. The room was spacious and very cozy. There have been no problems during our stay. We were just there for a night, but we had a good time. The buffet was lovely as well. Can't wait for our nexr stay.\\adal\\Seda Ayala Centre Cebu is ideally located adjacent to the mall. Airport transfer was prompt and comfortable. Despite some online reservation hiccups, check-in was speedy since Gia at Front Desk quickly resolved the problem. Prior email arrangements with Misto Assistant Manager Adonis for lunch and dinner assured my group of a lovely and pleasurable dining experience. Angelica made sure we enjoyed our pasta and pizza buffet lunch which was quite interesting. We also got excellent menu recommendations from Camille who assisted my group of ten at dinner and everyone loved the a la carte dishes as well as her efficiency kind attention to detail. Breakfast buffet had the crispiest bacon, the freshest fruit, and a variety of dishes to relish.  It was a very relaxing and hassle-free\\Cliff C\\The hotel's staff were wearing smile and polite all the time and gave me a lot of support when I needed. the room was clean and cozy, but noise seemed easily transparent from the one next door.   Gym equipment is maintained well, despite they had been used for years.  Besides that, this hotel is really recommended for the food, ambience, staffs, pool and pool side bar, and most importance is the location and even easy access to Ayala mall .\\gerarduy2023\\very good service, satisfied, nice place to stay. airport and hotel transfer very prompt. no waiting time. we will definitely come back next time we visit cebu.  highly recommended.. same as your other affiliate hotels here in Metro Manila\\Stay358177\\Our stay in the hotel was above expectations. The staff and crew were very pleasant and courteous enough to interact with. Rooms and amenities were pretty clean and convenient. Overall, our experience here in Seda Ayala Center Cebu was very good.\\Gregg F\\Stopped in after a week of business travel for some relaxation.  The hotel is located in the heart of Cebu City next to a very nice mall. Firstly, the staff is really nice and helpful here. The ladies at the front desk helped us multiple times with finding places and making dinner reservations. The hotel is older with faded carpet, but is still quite nice and very clean. The best part is the room air conditioning works great and doesn’t turn off in the middle of the night like some other hotels.  When going into the Club Lounge, Mary was always there with a big smile and offered a little chit chat asking how the day went or how dinner was.  As a traveler with elite status at multiple hotel chains, I always appreciate that personal touch like remembering my name and the things I\\Apple T\\Thanks to Christopher Crisologo for arranging a birthday cake. He is very professional in dealing guests needs. Marlo during bfast was very attentive,Nica, Karen at the front desk very efficient. Front desk staffforgot the name who extended our LCO was flexible.\\Jess S\\Stayed here twice on separate occasions during our recent holiday in Cebu. Staff were very friendly throughout the duration of both our stays. Front desk helped organised late check out and airport transfer, both reasonably priced. Location is fantastic, only a  5min walk to Ayala mall and the many restaurant options. Pool was ok, smaller than what we expected. Breakfast buffet was great, lots of options to choose from. Note need to go before 8am to avoid the rush otherwise will need to wait for a table. Beds are comfortable. Rooms are reasonably clean however the bathrooms could use a deep clean, visible mould in the shower, basin, bidet hose, and rusty garbage bin. There is a mini fridge in the rooms however they didn’t get very cold even after trying to adjust the settings.\\theflyingtrainer\\The good. Great location. Right beside a good mall. In the mornings, you can walk/jog around the mall garden. Appetizing breakfast buffet. Friendly staff. Clean rooms.  The bad. Conference room projectors are blurry.\\P.M.\\First and foremost - The staff of Seda - from security to reception to housekeeping to maintenance to the Misto Restaurant have all been exceptional!  Smiles and greetings everyday!  We stayed long term (two weeks) - I normally try to book directly with hotels, but the Seda price was $2,976 (AUD) - so I ended up booking through Agoda for $2,283 (AUD) - a saving of $700 (AUD).  We stayed in room 429 - with a view of the street front of the hotel just over the roof line of the entry.  (Last year in November we stayed for 3 nights on the 6th floor with a view of the Ayala Center Terraces and it was a great view especially since Ayala was decorated for Christmas).  It would have been nice to have a room on the Ayala side since we were staying so long, but probably ended up on the\\janethharvey\\This was our first stay at the Seda brand, although we have stayed at this location when it was a Marriott.  We were quite  impressed with the quality of the rooms, the polite and very attentive staff, food, value, and overall atmosphere of this excellent hotel.  The hotel's proximity to an excellent mall, variety of food offerings, and atmosphere, were all excellent.  We look forward to our return trips.\\Cindy T\\The service is great - efficient staff esp at the buffet room, in particular staff named Ivy and Angeline!  Our room is always nicely made up by our cleaners Rafgi and Julu! Food needs improvement though.    The congee is inconsistent, sometimes watery n sometimes thick.  There need to be a better toaster for breads that couldn't fit on slice bread slots. Attended the Seafood Friday, the service catering on servicing the lobster  was not only slow, it was chaotic such that our individual lobsters got mixed up at our table, some of which we didn't even order!  And the lobsters were not fresh - they were mushy rather than tangy.  Orange juice was too watered down.\\Excursion12625727268\\Really nice hotel. The breakfast and dinner buffets were amazing, especially the seafood buffet on Friday’s. Special mention to Angelica on the day shift in the restaurant. Very friendly and made me feel very welcome.\\ysilk85\\It was so nice as a hotel located next to Ayala Mall, shopping and dining were so convenient, and the hotel breakfast was satisfactory. I was impressed by the fact that the staff were friendly and tried to help.\\HmDePerio\\I have always love seda. Theres no question to it. I know i always get a good sleep at seda. Clean sheets and towels.  The staff were very courteous and friendly. Although some needs to greet and acknowledge the guest at all time. For the past two weeks of my trip i have been to few hotels and greeting a guest on the hallways or anywhere in the establishment is a plus.\\Carsten R\\As always when we travel to the Philippines we stay at Seda Ayala Center Cebu. We stayed in a Junior Suite, which had a small anteroom with a sofa, table, closet and TV. I knew this suite and everything was as expected. When making the reservation I had ordered an extra bed, this was shown on the reservation with a one-time 2,000 peso. In the hotel I should pay this amount then daily, we have then waived it and used the sofa as a sleeping accommodation.  The room cleaning was sometimes very slow, we have made with the employee partly a cleaning appointment, which was then also times not kept. We also had to call after the room cleaning because the soap or toilet paper was not refilled.   We had booked the room with breakfast, the rich breakfast internationally oriented and\\anamhipolito24\\Location is superb. Staff are great. Easy to deal with and guests were well taken care of with simple requests,even there are lots of guests during our  stay.we will consider to stay here again.i just hope the lobby will ne more modern feels  just like here in manila.pls replace the  bathroom towels with new one.i think its too old to use.\\RetiredLEOPCSO\\The location of this hotel makes it great for travelers, who do not want to travel far to find decent food. The DJ near the pool every evening add some ambience. The employees are always kind in engaging with visitors. The breakfast is better than most the hotel is getting Older but it’s still comfortable and clean generally.\\Orly D\\I have been staying at this property for many years now even before it became SEDA. It is a very convenient place being just beside a mall and highly secure, the kind most travelers are looking for in a hotel.\\pattidapitan\\Overall my review is great,  room is always made by Ericson (our attendant) my check in was prompt thru the help of Stephen.  The whole housekeeping team under the supervision of Darvey Demicillo was excellent.  I can't thank everybody enough, it made my stay a very pleasant 3 days.\\rvt1988\\One of the better Seda Hotels. Very clean and comfortable rooms. The couch in our room is soft and the pillows are very soft. Quality and variety of breakfast food is also excellent. Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends.\\Kathy T\\What can I say about Seda Ayala Center Cebu and Seda IT Bloc. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay safe and stress free. We've enjoyed everyone hospitality and the securities made us feel valued. The people in Seda are beautiful and kind. I would recommend anyone to consider staying here. It has all the amenities since the mall is right next door. Thank you, Seda for the warm and amazing stay!\\indiana712023\\The junior is very basic and bland. No iron and bathroom door won’t close. The toiletries provided were too tiny. The closet had no iron and was open with no cover. It did not look like a four star hotel room.  The staff were very courteous and nice!\\F. Scott\\As much as I wanted to give a perfect score, I decided not to because I believe that there’s always a room for improvement.  This used to Marriot hotel and I stayed once before with my husband. I tried to refresh my memory on comparing everything. But i guess, there’s only a couple of things that’s make it different. Anyway, I would like to applaud all the staff for doing their job so well. They are very friendly, accommodating, hospitable, courteous, respectful and very warm. The location of this hotel is very accessible and it’s very safe. The buffet was really good. Overall, this hotel is a great place to stay. Truly, great staff and great service…\\elginleon\\Not the hotels fault but we stayed in the gumamela room for several hours due to availability, but when we were checked in everything was perfect, the staff was friendly and accommodating, keep it up guys!! Y’all are the best!!\\Trex1887\\Our experience in SEDA Ayala Cebu is very good. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. The room is very comfortable and connectivity is fast. The location of the hotel is just right for us to experience Cebu City. The overall experience is very satisfactory.",,,,,,

We are checking into NuStar Fil hotel right after we checked out from Sheraton Mactan resort for 3 days and 3 nights.

We arrived we multiple large luggage’s and although there are multiple hotel personnel standing by the x-ray machine no one dares to help us unload our stuff. After they x-rayed our bags no one guided us where to go and they just stand there and busy themselves chitchatting. We carried all our bags to the elevator.

The hotel is located in the complex with restaurants and casino. However, the mall section still under construction.  Check In and check out progress is slow but helpful staff.

The hotel is modern, clean,stylish and very luxurious from lobby to convention and rooms, it was extremely elegant and spacious.The food was great too. The hotel employees were very friendly. Although, I would say that there is room for improvement in terms of service. In particular, as we were preparing  in the Convention Hall B for the plenary meeting. I requested one male wait staff for chairs to be placed in the control booth, I waited for the chairs for about 20 minutes but the guy did not come back, so I went out to the lobby and was waiting for him impatiently as we needed the chairs but I could not find him, until one female wait staff named Lyn approached me and asked if she\\Oleg Mikhailov\\I visited Cebu for the ABAC and stayed here. Excellent Service from the hotel staff, upon arrival I was given a welcoming drink by a tall pretty lady named Lyn, what caught my attention is her warm and welcoming smile. The orange fizz was refreshing by the way. The room was very spacious, clean and had the amenities needed. Breakfast was delicious and with many choices. The people in the reception were very helpful in checkin and check out. Transaction was smooth. The convention were we held the meetings was very clean and staffs were very quick to replenish water, pencils and paper. Coffee and tea was good and Lyn was there too always smiling and helpful in giving directions to spots. She also recommended Fina restaurant and food was great. The location is great and near\\NewYorkWorldExplorer\\The hotel is part of the Nustar resort in the South Reclamation area which is a few minutes away from all the tourist spots and Cebu’s business district. The rooms are sparkling new and have beautiful views of the Mactan Bridge, the water, downtown, and the hills which all light up nicely at night. The bathrooms are luxurious and all amenities are provided. The most enjoyable part of our stay was the breakfast buffet at the Fili Cafe. Food was delicious and service was top notch. At the time of our visit, the mall, the sauna and spa, and certain areas of Nustar resort were still under construction or not yet operational. I expect it to be a popular destination when the entire Nustar resort is fully operational in 2024. Thumbs up!\\Stephanie C\\I am curious about the newest & famous 5 star hotel in Cebu City! As a family, we decided to dine in FILI cafe. The name itself is classy and inviting as well. So we decided to try just this month of Julu & I was surprised by the authenticity of the food! It was soooo delish and worth every penny! PLUS, the staff named DAN who accommodated is was very witty and his services to us was outstanding! He made us feel comfortable always and he was mindful everytime we need some assistance. Dan is highly commendable if only I have more time to commend him at that moment. He is one of the best servers I have ever met! Will definitely dine again at Fili and looking forward for Dan to assist us. Kudos to the entire staff for the great service. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\\Travel@buckets\\Good modern business hotel  New facilities  Booked a sea view room  Check in was uneventful  Staff are very attentive  Some facilities are still not open at the time  Pool side has great views but there’s no bar service -(  Room ample space for 2 adults  Beds pillows are very comfortable  Breakfast was great - multiple Asian and western selections  Tried Fili restaurant which is within the premises and the food is not only good but reasonably priced  Overall stay was satisfactory , close enough to explore the City so I would stay here again.\\Lynne Smith\\This is one of the newest hotels in Cebu City, so our family opted to visit this place. The property is still under construction especially the Nustar hotel.  This place was great and you have plenty of great restaurants from Michelin star to great Steakhouse you can choose from. Also, the staff were all nice and accommodating, special mention to Jane from the front desk and to the housekeeping team who maintains our room clean and tidy. One thing I noticed though is that we kept hearing noises outside our room at some point during our stay so I figured it was not really a sound proof one. The breakfast buffet was mouthwatering even though the varieties were kinda limited. Overall it was a great stay and definitely coming back.\\Tim W\\Coffee and frappes were great, blueberry muffin was soft and not too sweet. The ambiance is very luxurious and comfortable. Prices not too high despite the location and 5-star hotel location. Elvie was very accommodating and helpful.\\Xheelah M\\Very accommodating crew. The food is really authentic and delicious. They also have a surprise sing and dance presentation for the birthday celebrant. The ambiance is good and they also have a very cold air-conditioning.\\Getaway39393312579\\I went with my work colleagues. Their food is very yummy food and they have friendly and best service! I will love to go back and dine with my family soon. By the way our server is Ran2x, a very kind server.\\ingrid b\\Always a great experience! Such accommodating staffs and great relaxation with the room and the amenities.

Will come back very soon. 🫰🏻🫰🏻🫰🏻\\Ladylyn L\\We dont like the beef kare kare and the oven baked tahong. The price doesnt justify the taste. Takes too long to serve the foods.   Shoutout to our very good servers, kim & robert. They made it  bearable with their services.\\Sara S\\We just got here in cebu and we are all hungry. We ordered a variety of dishes.

He keeps asking us what we else we need.. He serve us very fine, we felt comfortable and satisfied. And the food are also great\\Sakurayku\\I had a great experience staying at Fili, the staff were very hospitable. I would like to say a good job for the housekeeping team for their work, keep it up! My room was very clean and tidy which I appreciate, I would like to thank Kurt, Rose and Franz for that. The Fili Cafe had nice employees and would accommodate to our needs and the food was great!

Special shoutout to Febe for being so kind, friendly and looking after us so well! The staff at the egg station makes really good omelettes too! Ask for the sea view room! Do note there’s not much of a beach though, and come early for breakfast if you want a table outside facing the sea!\\경 민\\I asked the front desk for help to eat Jollibee, which I really wanted to try in Cebu. (We couldn't use the Grab application) Ericson, a front desk clerk, made a great effort to order the menu from his personal cell phone. It was very touching to try to fulfill the request that the hotel system could not make. While trying to order, Jollibee's business hours were over, so we couldn't eat it, but later he found a Jollibee that wasn't closed personally and showed it to us. (Then we were in the pool and he came to see us himself!) But we had already placed an order at the hotel restaurant Sunset Bar. I couldn't eat Jollibee because it was the last day of our trip, but I was very touched by his passionate service. All the facilities in the hotel were excellent, the staff were\\윤경 이\\Every employees are kind  I ate pizza and cocktails  I love here cocktails I fall in love with cosmopolitan  Thank u for good service !  It was good vacation If u visit sunset bar u can see nice scenery\\Mississippi Analytics\\The place is a slice of paradise, no doubt. The beach, the swanky rooms, it's like stepping into a dream. But here's the thing: their Wi-Fi game. I mean, you're in this stunning tropical heaven, but the Wi-Fi acts like it's on a beach vacation too – super slow and kinda unreliable. So if you're planning to upload all those jealousy-inducing beach pics or even just stream your favorite show, you might be in for some frustration. It's like paradise with a side of digital detox, whether you asked for it or not! 🏖️📶\\Michael T\\Very bad check-in experience, they were able to give the requested room at 3:45 pm where in the checkin time is 3 pm.  Unprofessional front desk manager and receptionists.  Pricey buffet food, not so special and they are very slow in refilling the food items.  Would not recommend this place\\OnAir684175\\Our stay at the Dusit Thani was exceptional. From the moment we checked in we could not fault the resort or the service. The buffet breakfast was amazing, the facilities and the pool were world class and the bar service from JV and Lee was wonderful. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone considering a vacation in Cebu\\재석 이\\EDZEZ NOTWIN is very kind, and awesome!!!  I visited for the 1st anniversary of my marriage and it was nice to meet a good staff.  It was very delicious and the staff was very friendly.   I will visit again\\FourAs\\(-) The soundproofing of the room needs improvement, we can hear the next room watching TV, moving their stuffs. The room itself is quite basic same as the bathroom for the price paid or for a Dusit Thani hotel.  A bathtub would have been nice as commented by my son.  Bath towels seem like beach towels, they were too big. We were told that our rooms have king sized beds, there were twin beds.  (+) Dusit Thani hospitality still felt and happy about it. Great staff from the arrival, restaurants, housekeeping, pool, ground, they were friendly and genuine. No problem with parking.  Sunset view was superb either from the infinity pool or the bar.  On food, we had the following: in this order ---- dessert and coffee at The Deli, merienda at Sunset Sports Bar, dinner at Benjarong and\\Delyn M\\The service was very good, and our stay was so relaxing. This place is great for relaxation and to unwind. The amenities, activities and swimming locations was superb! Good value for the money and the breakfast was delicious.  I had a great experience with one of the staff Joey he was very hospitable and helpful for every need of mine. 10/10 recommended and will go again.\\Jamessl M\\Absolutely brilliant, Great atmosphere, Wonderful food and Beautiful Room view. The is a little bit far away from the City,but great place to relax and enjoy the sunset and infinity pool. Friendly staff specially Joey the one cleaning my room thank you buddy and to Dusit staff.\\Haven A.\\I love spending so much time in here. Everything was nice! The room was very spacious, clean, and had the amenities we needed. Breakfast was delicious and with many choices; it was a very wide buffet spread. The staff here Gabriel and Christy were very pleasant, helpful and catered our needs extremely well. They are amazing and could not have been more accommodating. I would recommend to my friends, and will definitely stay again if Im back to Cebu.\\stevekettle\\Fun place - rooms good and serviced well , good F&B , service can be hit & miss but generally with a smile , so as long as you not in a rush all good . Massive pool , and places upbeat music so not for a quiet time .. would recommend ...... be prepared to wait at peak hours for breakfast\\Seung eun L\\Norwin treated us kindly, so we made a good memory!  And place was convenient to eat because it was right in front of the swimming pool!!    Also the cocktail recommendation was very good :) thanks!!\\chunghun ha\\I stayed at the Dujithani Hotel for 2 nights and 3 days and used the club lounge. The memories here were so good. Both afternoon tea and dinner-time services provided the best food, location and service. The staff here, especially Gerson, was kind, took pictures of us, and treated us very well. If I come to the Philippines next time, I will use the Dujithani Hotel again and reserve a club room where the club lounge is always available.\\Martha M\\I admire everything! This place is very tremendous, charming and lavish. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. Facilities are great and modern. The pool was very beautiful and warm. The room was so comfy, especially the pillows. I love this hotel!",,,,,,

Great accommodating staff. Shoutout to Rengie who was very welcoming at the breakfast buffet, she truly made sure we had the best dining experience.

We always book with breakfast included in the daily rate. The Buffet Breakfast is voted Best in Cebu. There’s excellent spread and food selection in the Pusô Restaurant. We are always spoiled by the staff i.e. Eric, John, Job, Mark, Juicy and Rana. Shout out to Eric and John for always preparing our coffee and pot of black tea and to Juicy for our over easy and sunny side up eggs and the bowl of noodle soup. The fresh fruits (mango, banana and water melon) are sweet and delicious. The native puto maya plus hot sikwati (100% chocolate) are also our favorites.

You can tell from their Front Office, Restaurant, & Housekeeping that they value guest satisfaction the most.  Ian at the Front Desk welcomes us with a warm smile.  He exceeds professionalism in handling guests.  The entire stay was amazing.  We will definetely comeback.\\Karla B\\Quest has been our always go-to hotel whenever our company is organizing a business trip. I had stayed at the hotel for numerous times already, even during pandemic and their quality has been maintained since then. Starting from airport pick up until the actual hotel stay, everything goes smoothly!  The staffs were so helpful, polite, proactive and hospitable to their guests. Rooms are very neat and well maintained, they also have a rack for iron and you can borrow an iron from them anytime.  And not forgetting to mention that their buffet breakfast is UNMATCHED 🥘🥙🍲 you’ll have variety of options to full your stomach in almost a whole day. Food options comes friendly to everyone even for vegetarian (they have salads, fruits, etc.) and a good representation of a Cebuano\\Michael John\\I had a remarkable stay at Quest Hotel and Conference Center Cebu where the concierge and attendants displayed exceptional hospitality, even allowing us to check in an hour early and storing our luggage while we waited for our pristine and impeccably clean room, which was a delight. The only suggestion I have for improvement would be to consider adding Netflix to the television options, as the available channels were limited. Nonetheless, the outstanding service and impeccable rooms make this hotel highly recommendable for anyone seeking a top-notch stay in the area, and I eagerly anticipate my return in the future.\\Elsa F\\Good customer service and good food i would like to comment to jules in charleys bar hes very friendly good drinks also and i meet a lot of friends i will be back for sure i will try the hotel check in.

Our family thoroughly enjoyed the daily breakfast, skillfully supervised by Sir Job.  The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the birthday party for my father, organized flawlessly with the assistance of Sir Yoyong, the F&B manager. The event was a success, accommodating our relatives and showcasing the hotel's commitment to making special occasions truly remarkable.  Miss Joyce and Sir Cesar took care of our stay and accommodation, ensuring our comfort and satisfaction throughout.

Location is very convenient if you want to avoid any horrible traffic.\\Nel\\1.  We were told to wait for the room as they're still setting up the extra bed (with paid extra person charge).  but when we entered the room there was no extra bed and we had to call room service to set it up.   2.  Before booking I contacted the hotel via FB messenger to inquire about extra person charge (16 years old).  I was told that rate per night  is 1200 no breakfast or 1800 with breakfast - but upon checking in we were obliged by receptionist Shao to pay for the extra with breakfast as according to him it is required for extra person to have breakfast.. I asked twice and told him that I know it's not required but he insisted that it is required... I don't know who's not telling the truth (your messenger admin or the receptionist?)  3.  We're required to have breakfast\\bennever l\\The place was very clean and well maintained. The staff are very friendly helpful and accommodating…. Had a great experience.

Her tireless diligence and constant dedication are remarkable. She was always on the move, ensuring that everything in the restaurant was in perfect order, all with remarkable discipline. Her dedication and commitment are palpable and made my stay even more enjoyable.  Franz is a true asset to the hotel.

Visitors were engaged through interactive activities, such as the paint wall, which added a creative dimension to the visit. Although not as accessible as other museums, likely due to its affiliation with a school, the museum's hidden location added to its charm and exclusivity.

USC upholds the importance of history and that is shown how the museum is well-curated.

The meticulous restoration work carried out on the house is evident in every detail, allowing visitors to truly appreciate the authenticity and charm of the original structure. It's a testament to the dedication and passion of the individuals involved in maintaining this cultural landmark. The interior of the Jesuit House is a treasure trove of artifacts and antiques.

Walking through the rooms felt like stepping into a different era, with each item telling a unique story of the people who once inhabited the house.|SofiaB|The Jesuit House was an interesting visit. The house was able to preserve its vintage quality. We were able to learn about its history through the photos posted on its walls and the information given to us by the stationed guides. I also liked viewing the vintage items and artifacts that were on display. Lastly, I enjoyed listening to the harp performer present at the time.|Trisha Rebayla|The 1730 Jesuit House is certainly a hidden treasure within Parian. I noticed that the museum had areas which were still under construction. Despite that, the staff were quite welcoming with their sunny disposition and warm greetings as my friends and I entered the site. I would like to add that having free ice cream to end the museum tour was a brilliant idea! It was a humid night and it really helped cool us down.Although the whole concept of being a ""hidden treasure"" is great, I would recommend having 2-3 people from the staff accommodate guests from the outside (preferably where you could see traffic - the kind where there are people walking along the street) and not just from the registration area. My friends and I had difficulty finding the museum because of how mysterious it looked when in reality, we actually passed by the area at one point and did not even realize that it was a museum that was part of Gabii sa Kabilin 2023.I also suggest to improve the lighting from the outside because the street where the museum is located was quite dark which made my friends and I hesitant to go along that part of the road.Regardless, we have learned so much being inside the museum. It was like revisiting history all over again as we looked at the furniture, the infrastructure as a whole, and of course, the artifacts which were housed within the museum.Good luck on your future events! I hope to see you guys again the next time there'll be another GSK!|Nicole D|Although the museum have some parts under construction, the staffs are really accommodating and I can really now understand why is it called ""a secret museum"" because at first glance you won't know it's a museum because it is used as a hardware warehouse but inside lies an old house well maintained by the people who works there.|Reann G|Love the airconditioned place.

Displays and galleries are well organized that its indeed a travel through time capsules.   Length of visit is dependent on whether one wants to read al the write ups.

The building had plenty of marble and its makes for a good instagram picture, but really, what’s it for given it has four floors and about 12 rooms per floor, some of which are not quite finished and appear uninhabited.I understand that owner made his fortune in property and five years ago, the entrance fee was 50 peso, with seniors and children free.  Now it’s more than doubled to 120 peso for adults with a concessionary price for others. Not quite sure if this is to recover the cost or to pay the singer who adds ambience and character to what otherwise could be, unintentionally perhaps,  a shrine.|Chi_Tiff|I absolutely love my experience here. I’m not sure if it happens all the time, but the day I went there was a violinist paying music there. It created a great vibe!! The views were spectacular and I arrived just before sunset. I’d definitely recommend this place. A guy took me on his motorbike for 500 pesos from the Taosist Temple, waited while I took my photos and hung out and then drove me back to my hostel!  Another driver tried to charge me 1500 for the same trip so definitely beware of being taken advantage of!|Alleonah Patric... C|The view and place is very nice, you can see that the husband who really adored his wife so much! However, the place is still under construction like the basement and the behind part.. the entrance fee is too expensive tho for only seeing the front and the view.. we wanted to see the things inside but it was locked up and we. An only see from outside through the window only. We do hope the next time we visit we can definitely come inside and see everything not just the statues and the view|penelope j|The temple was created by one of the richest husband in Cebu for his wife, obviously. From a far it was ominous, and you expected more. The place however, is not accessible for what it was advertising .It tells the story of a wife who was loving and loves to collect “nice stuff. All of these “nice stuff “ are all locked up. You will not be able to see it, you will be disappointed because you were charged an entrance fee, and you expected more.|Aurora_Nomad|To be honest, and with all due respect to the memory of the lady, the place is a tasteless imitation of European palaces. There was innovation going on at the time of my visit, but to me the visit was really not worth it.|Czar Emmanuel|The first time I visited this place, its basement was still under construction. Well, even up to now its rooms, where some art collections of the Albano-Adarna family are supposed to be on display, are still under construction and closed to the public. However, there have been some notable changes. There's a restaurant now in the basement and entrance to the temple is no longer free. I also noticed that more people were visiting the place, turning this once private family mausoleum into one of Cebu City's tourist destinations. There's also more traffic, with a long queue of cars waiting to find a slot for a  pay.|richj65|It's clearly Greek inspired but it has a Filipino twist. Perfect combination from the structures  the view and the pleasant environment. Good place to relax.|Brix510|This place was very well made and erected as a dedication of love to leah.  However the upkeep is pretty much non existent and it's sad to see the current state - but even with minimal upkeep its very nice|penasihatperjalanan|This location is a wedding venue that is partially open as a tourist trap. Most of the interior is closed and tourists are only permitted outside on the large scenic veranda and inside beneath the domed entry area. There's nothing to do here except to pose beside the statues, with a backdrop of structures of architectural interest or a view of the city far below. If you had to choose between views or talking selfies here or the nearby The Tops, there's little difference and there's no reason to visit both.|aaddelgado|Massive structure but not much to see inside. Not much to do. Still incomplete. View is nice. There were a lot of people visiting. Parking is available. Overall, the entrance fee of Php100 is too pricey.|Kristine R|Before our Cebu trip in May 2022, I have never heard about the Temple of Leah. We only learned about the place thru the cab driver who took us to our hotel from the Mactan Airport upon our arrival. We arranged a city tour with the driver the next day, and voila! We were on our way to the temple, which was perched high up in the mountainous part of Cebu City. The Temple was named after the late Leah Albino-Adarna, the grandmother of Filipino starlet Ellen Adarna. Because of its location, the temple offers a breathtaking view of Cebu City, and inevitably gives visitors a feeling that they are abroad due to the Greek-inspired architecture. The place is good for taking pictures, and gives a glimpse of the grandmother’s collection of jars, liquor bottles, and other ornaments. The Temple of Leah is one of Cebu City’s must-see attractions that will be enjoyed by tourists of all ages.|TengCorrea|Dubbed as Cebu's Taj Mahal, this majestic structure is dedicated by a husband to his late wife. Its lies in the details as in its giant pillars, intricately designed staircase and high golden ceiling. Place also houses various items collected from wife's travels. It's not open when I visited but you can peek through the windows to have a look.Located 45 mins from the city center, one can take habal-habal in front of JY Square Mall. I got mine for Php400 which includes visits to Sirao Pictorial Garden and the newly opened Little Kyoto.Entrance fee at Php100. There's a snack and souvenir kiosk right by the plaza area. Without having to buy anything though, you can sit in one of their huts. There's a view of the city from there.

The entrance fee is 70 Pesos (As of May 2023). Expect a crowd and patience is a virtue if you want to have a picture with the famous golden hand. Actually, there's four of it. There are two huge golden hands, and two small ones. Since the line is quite long for the huge golden hands, I decided to just take a picture with the small ones as we still have another destination that day. I stood in line for almost 20 mins and yet, I'm not even close. Some takes more than 10 minutes in taking pictures. So imagine that? More than 10 minutes per person. During our time, most of the visitors are foreign, you can count with your hands how many are the Filipinos in line. I highly suggest that you make this as your last destination so you can spend all the time here and you won't have to hurry because you still have another place to go but it would be much better if there's someone who facilitates to ensure that a guest won't spend too much time to consider also there are a lot of other guests waiting for their turn. Also, there's a restroom in the area but in the far end of the garden. Before you exit, you can buy some souvenirs. Outside the garden, you can try out the smoked banana cue, buko juice and other meriendas available.|Len Mian|This garden also nicknamed the Amsterdam of Cebu, is an Instagram paradise.   Very nice views and flowers in the high country.  Lots of elevation climbing by car to get to this spot.  The trip is worth it.|DrNBA|One of the most beautiful views in Cebu! This Garden was filled with wonderfully bloomed flowers, areas to take pictures and most important, the mountains! Great creation on the mountainside!|joycehehe|A long drive from Mactan- more than 1hr. View is beautiful with fresh flowers. However, hard to walk to. Place is not accessible at all via wheel chair and is not senior-citizen friendly at all.Still worth the long drive for me. Very picturesque. Suggest to go early morning or late afternoon because the place has no shade at all.|penelope j|Beautiful flowers and set up. However, the place was not accessible. It’s a bit of a drive from the city of Cebu. The road was a little bit treacherous going there, requiring you to have a great driver. Some areas are a bit rundown. All in all the experience was good.|Aurora_Nomad|Visited with co-workers, and thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful garden, and plenty of opportunities to take memorable photos (some are cheesy, but the hands snd some other ones were enjoyable). It is a drive from Cebu city (took us some 40mins), but we all liked it. Fun fact: check out the Mickey Mouse fruit (not edible, but fun looking).|Sharon Rogers|This will always be such a wonderful memory of my trip to the Phillipines. So cleverly put together, gorgeous views and the gardens tendered to so beautifully. The sculptures the whole experience is not to miss 12 out of 10 from me. Definately worth the visit.🙏❤️|Chevy|Perfect venue for pictorial. All the spots are eye candy and amazing to capture that will contribute to making a memorable experience.|Irish Mae|we are a bit disappointed when we went there since there are less flowers due to typhoon odette, We did not able to experience and see the beautiful scenery of siarao garden based on pictures. But it is understandable due to typhoon odette.We will be back here this coming March or April, and as per our tour agency, this is the perfect time to grow back the flowers.|TengCorrea|I learned this just now but apparently, there are two Sirao gardens in Cebu and this one is for Sirao Pictorial Garden and Camping Site (PGCS). It's a small place. where there are several structures where one can pose for photos against lovely beautiful mountainous backdrop. Most famous of which are the giant hands. There are some flower beds as well. If you're worried about the heat, there are huts or shaded areas where you can rest for a bit. Located about 45mins fr Cebu City, one can take habal-habal from in front of JY Square Mall. You can negotiate but got mine for Php400. There's an additional fee if driver to come in and take your photos. Other sites to visit near area are Temple of Leah, Tops and Little Kyoto. Best to come in the morning because around noon, it can get crowded that people take turns with the more popular pictorial sites. Entrance fee at 60 pesos. There's a small shop near the entrance that sells drinks and snacks as well as souvenirs. Note though that they don't allow visitors to bring water bottles inside.|Junlen Antonio|When my family and I decided to visit Cebu we started looking for some attractions to visit then we stumbled upon a post about Sirao Garden. The photos are just so beautiful and so we made sure to check out the place and it is indeed beautiful. The flowers are so colorful it’s like it would make you feel so happy inside by seeing those vibrant colors. The view is so breathtaking as well I couldn’t help but appreciate and stare at it because it is just so peaceful. I am just so happy that my family and I visited this place and we would surely go back soon.|irenevff|because of the pandemic, i find it fortunate that there was not a crowd flocking this garden in the mountainous area of the city. it was a splendid sight showcasing plants and flowers of various colors with a little feel of amsterdam. the windmills are an eye candy. smelling the flora is effortless. the sweet scents emanating from the flowers can reach your nostrils even when you are wearing face mask & shields. there was strictly a 'no touch' sign in every corner for the safety of both plants and guests.for a measly fee of Php60, you can have the entire garden for yourself, for as long as you would want to stay.|Sazeena N|Very pretty place with a view.

Y|I'm proud to be a YAP because of my father, and my Chinese Ancestor. I may not the only 1, but many.|Simon C|Apparently, this is the oldest Chinese house in Cebu and I was told “most is original”.  I am sceptical, the floorboards like more like 35 years old not 350 and nails were not around in the 1670s.  The owners, I mam told,  stay at weekends, but hard to see quite where since their bedroom looked very unoccupied. One uncomfortable moment was in the garden where there is a harpist, who for a few peso, will play a little, at which three young children- aged between 4-7, dressed in traditional dress wake up (or are woken) from dozing in a nearby room and rush to perform a series of whirls and swirls.  They don’t look happy and I felt this bordered on child abuse.  The harpist told me these were his children, so does this make it ok?|alwaystravelsf|Wasn’t expecting much but I have to admit it was fascinating to see such an old house and being able to walk around and they even allow you to sit on furniture and touch some artifacts.  Just be respectful as it’s old.  The upstairs was cool and the bedroom is there where apparently the owners stay on weekends.  An old man was playing an old Harp and beautiful song, Fools Rush In by Elvis.|Escapementality|According to the Guide to the Philippines website, this house is not only one of the oldest in the Philippines and home to the family who helped found Cebu's Sinulog festival, but perhaps the first Chinese house built outside of China.Why such a low score for such a historic place. then?Because as a historical experience, which the Yap San Diego Ancestral House is billed as, it fails to educate the visitor at all. We visited hoping to learn something about the multicultural history of Cebu, but what little we did learn came from looking things up online after the fact.I couldn't help but compare this house to another old house that we visited nearby later in the day, the Casa Gorordo museum. While the Yap San Diego house is much older, Casa Gorordo does a far better job of communicating its history to visitors, with interactive screens, and tablet-based audiovisual tours included in the ticket price.Judging by past reviews, it appears that there used to be costumed tour guides to help people understand the property, but we saw no-one and no mention of any such service. It's incredible to me that both Yap San Diego and Gorordo charge the same 100 peso entry fee when YSD is so much smaller, less preserved, and provides no services to guests, at least when we visited.While I understand that the Yap San Diego house may not have the same funding as Casa Gorordo, surely a photocopied info sheet could be included with the admission. Or at a minimum. signs to help visitors understand the significance of the items in the house. That being said, I question the significance of many of the items. Every room is full of things, many arranged in strange ways (like a ceramic baby Jesus and a stack of abacuses sitting on an old chair). Some seem quite old, others much more modern. And there are no instructions requesting visitors refrain from touching the items or using the furniture. In fact, the majority of visitors appeared to be using the house as a backdrop for selfies, where they could sit in an antique chair by a window, or pretend to have afternoon tea with old dishes. From the people hawking souvenirs outside to the buskers inside. the house has more of a feeling of a tourist trap than a place designed with the history lover or cultural preservation in mind.In short, if you are just looking for a place to take some photos, the Yap San Diego house will probably suit your needs. If you are looking to learn about the history and culture of Cebu, you should either do a lot of research beforehand. or better yet, go to Casa Gorordo instead of you are short on time. It's a real shame, as obviously, the time periods and cultural backgrounds represented by these two houses are quite different, but unless the Yap San Diego Ancestral House takes some steps to educate visitors, I can't really recommend it as a place to learn more about Cebu, at least on its own. If you have ample time, it's a decent add-on to Casa Gorordo, since it's so close by. I'd recommend asking if there are guides available. All the staff there did was take our money, no information was provided.|loo c|The Yap-Sandiego Ancestral House is a must-visit heritage site in Cebu City. It offers a glimpse into the traditional Chinese-Filipino lifestyle during the Spanish colonial period. The house is well-preserved and showcases traditional architecture, antique furniture, pottery, and artwork. The porcelain and ceramic plates on the walls are a highlight. Guided tours are available to visitors, and the house's rich history and cultural significance make it a worthwhile stop for history and architecture buffs alike. The location in the Parian district adds to the charm of the attraction.|Czar Emmanuel|This ancestral house dating back to the 17th century is one of the main tourist attractions in Cebu City. It is located in the old Parian district of the city and is a silent witness to many historical events of the Filipino people. Inside you'll find lots of antiques. The house has two floors. The second floor is particularly interesting because of its old rooms (bedrooms, dining room, sala, etc.). Visiting this place is like travelling back in time. It is best to have a tour guide to explain to you the house's history, architecture, and the way people lived during that time.|Oscardog16|The ground floor reeked of urine. They had 2 toilets for public use but they stunk and it wafted all though the house. Upstairs was just a collection of crockery  and furniture. The displays exhibited no historical significance. Much lace to do about nothing.  If you bother to go in that is what you will see, lace adorning the tables, the window frames and the door arches. This is once you dodge the street hawkers that will not accept no for an answer. Not a place that is worth a stop.|Paz S|I visited this place in 2018 with my significant other and my daughter. The vibe was okay until we stepped into one of the bedroom. I think the house was haunted. It felt like we were not welcome in that room. I couldn’t breathe and felt uneasy, so we left.|Reslimpan|An old house with owners suffering from being hoarders, well perhaps an exaggeration but there is no rhyme or reason for the interior decoration, it has just been pieced together randomly.|Traveling Ammonite|Every single website on this place says the entrance fee is 50 Php per person, but they charged 100 per person in our group. They insisted ""iT wAs ChAnGeD iN SePtEmBeR lolol"" but failed to produce any source - even on their own website, that they themselves directed us to -  that mentioned this price change. Then they said ""Oh bUt iT wAs aNNouNcEd oN FaCeBoOk"" which, after checking out their Facebook, also wasn't true, and again they failed to produce proof that the price was raised to 100 per person.Foreigners beware, these guys are shady as hell and don't even know how to scam properly|Glenn W|The house structure is amazing enough but to add to that the house is jam packed with various collectables no doubt gathered by the family over a considerable period of time.

The rudeness of the staff also does not help.

Highly recommend it.|Colleen F|I really enjoyed a stroll around this house looking at all of the antiques. The staff is friendly and the furniture was lovely. It really does take you back in time. It is only 50 Pesos, so great value for money too. To note, I've seen some reviews from people complaining about the hot and stuffy interior and people should accept that this is the Philippines and there is no aircon inside the venue, so it is very hot and humid inside, as is to be expected.|neil5050|A fantastic experience with private tour guide. He knew everything about the house and was also a great photographer taking snaps of us posing in old day poses.I’m sorry I forgot his name but he is worth it and make sure you repay his great tour at the end.A must do in Cebu!!|TengCorrea|One of the oldest houses in the Philippines at 300 years, this ancenstral home stays strong as it is has been lived in and taken care of through 10 generations. Its original structure of wood, coral stones held together by egg yolks and red clay roof is retained at more than 90%.Aside from this structure and antique items on display, what's more lovely in this place is its story which the caretaker would be glad to share to you as you walk around. I like best its generosity that you can almost feel how its owners lived as you visit its various areas (including a functional bedroom). There are photos everywhere which give the feeling that you know them.On the practical end, with an entrance fee of Php50, you can roam freely at your pace, take snaps, even sit on chairs. Just make sure to not break any stuff.It is situated in the city near other sites like Casa Gorordo, heritage monument, Magellan's Cross and Basilica.|Francis_Elvis_Verdin|The historic residence was constructed in the 17th-century featuring hand-carved furniture, art & a garden.|Citra Jatmiko|The house was very “eye catching” so that you can easily spotted its building from the main street as you have to park your vehicle in another side of the street, since the main street was a bit narrow. There were so many Philippines’ flags and decorations over the house. There were also many signs and information boards in front of the House. There's a tour guide who'll tell the stories about the house comprehensively and very detailed. The house has two floors, while on first floor was all the main rooms, like family room, dining room, kitchen, and storage for all the stuffs. On the second floor, you will just find the bedrooms, main bedroom and other functional rooms. There's a beautiful mini garden outside the house, located at the backside of the house. Worth to visit, so far... especially for those ancient geeks and historical things' nerds.|Carlos Salinas|If you want to understand the history of this house, make sure to bring a tourist guide or make your own research.

It was a thoughtful and engaging approach that made the exhibits even more immersive.|Waldo Manalang|The museum offered a fascinating journey through the rich history and heritage of the region, with well-curated exhibits showcasing artifacts, photographs, and interactive displays. The restored building and knowledgeable staff made Museo Sugbo such a fun and knowlegable place to visit|Metchel Ann Rodriguez|One of the best museums we've ever been to. There are numerous artifacts and concise historical accounts. The timeline and information are quite well organized. Being there and getting a glimpse of Cebu's past feels really pleasant.|Rivkah Marie S|My favorite part was the secret thing inside the box and I was amazed by the arts inside it. I was a 10 for me.|Kurt E|One of the better museums that we have visited. Lots of artifacts and clear historical narratives. Great organization of  the timeline and facts. Feels very good to be there and have a glance on what the past Cebu looks like. A must visit for history enthusiasts. I wish they had more space for more artifacts though. Overall, it was a great learning experience.|Marty|Museo Sugbo ... is the Cebu Provincial Museum , located in the former Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center ( Prison ) This Cebu City Historical Museum , is found over a kilometre up the same road , from Plaza IndependenciaThe historical prison , now museum was built from coral stone ... some of this stone is from a demolished church , in the late 1870A few of this museums collection are :-• The Pre-Colonial Gallery• The Spanish Colonial Gallery• The Katipunan Revolution and the American Colonial Gallery• The War Memorial Gallery• The Museum of Philippine Political History The Prison housed not only criminals in its 135 year history - from 1870 to 2004. * During the revolution many of the Katipuneros ( revolutionist against Spanish Rule ) were incarcerated here without trial & many of them were eventually executed in nearby Carreta cemetery* During the Japanese occupation WW2 , guerrillas were imprisoned here , after enduring torture under the hands of the Kempeitai ( the Japanese secret police ) * After the war , many of the collaborators in Cebu were also imprisoned here|LolaGo1|On a Monday, I had a difficult time looking for transport from Fort San Pedro to this place.On my second attempt, I found it to be open and got excited when I learned that entrance fee is FREE!One room shows items related to various presidents of the. Philippines. Another one shows the history of Philippine Independence while another room shows relics of the past.Recommended to visit this FREE Museum!|Bea P|Cute free museum with multiple different exhibits ranging between the history of Cebuano press, the Japanese occupation, and city planning. Not necessarily a must-see, but definitely a nice respite from the searing heat if walking from Fort San Pedro to Casa Gorordo.|Lawland L|Great story about Cebu.  I started my trip with the visit and it gave me inspiration and a history that is meaningful and deep.  So much richness and details from prehistoric times and to present|Bob Ouano|Unlike Casa Gorordo which is privately run, this museum is government run (Province I think) and you can definitely tell the difference. Our tour guide was a student (Tourism I think{?} I forgot now), she had some knowledge of her subject matters and her grammar was quite faulty but made up for all of it with her attitude, smile, and very pleasant disposition. There were two sections of some five presentations, that had airconditioning and the rest you sweat like everybody else. The place is very accessible, and can be, maybe, enjoyable.|Kleinberg Fletc... T|Enrich your mind with knowledge about the past while having fun at the same time here in Museo Sugbo. Here you can learn lots of insights about how our forebears lived before, during, and after the Spanish Era. Read some letters written by Legazpi himself to the King of Spain (that's if you can understand Castilian, hehe), see an actual bomb used by the Americans during World War 2 (its really huge), and a lot more!There are just lots of things you can grasp here in Museo Sugbo. The museum has several galleries that features the entire era of Cebuano history, from the Precolonial up to the Japanese Occupation. There are also new galleries that were later added which are also very interesting to visit. The “Rice Gods and Saints” is a gallery that features a collection of anitos and pots in Ifugao. There is also a gallery for the National Historical Commission that elaborates the evolution of the “bayan” a local political entity during the precolonial era to the modern cities we have today.Each galleries are air-conditioned, with a free guided tour for your convenience. The entrance fee is only P75.00 but locals do get a much cheaper discounted price. A souvenir shop and a cafe is also available though it isn't open all the time.|Vic Raymund|This is used to be a Prison Cell & converted into a Museum. They also accepts for Functions & Party.|Andrew Scott G|Take the tour, the guides are great at showing you around and explaining things.  Lots of great artifacts and displays.|Felixberto E|The tour guide was very helpful with the historical display and artifacts, we got to learn more about own ethnic origins! Very interesting displays, very good museum guides.|Edwin R|This museum is not that big, but it packs a lot of history.  My favorite was during The World War II.  I didn't know that the Filipinos had briefly used Japanese currency.  Their new ""Rice of Gods"" room was amazing.  Our tour guide mentioned a private donor from a Filipino philanthropist, donated everything in the room to share the history of Cebu.  We were also educated that Museo Gugbo was originally a prison.  There were still marks of prisoners name and other carvings during that era.  One highlight that was also a favorite of mine was the walk of fame wall where all the past Presidents of the Philippines were hung in portrait paintings.  Next to their portraits shares a brief history of their life and accomplishments during their time in office.  I highly recommend if you have time during your visit to Cebu City, pay a visit here.  You will learn a great deal about Philippine history and the native tribes of Cebu.Cheers!"

All the small restaurants around the Lookout were all closed.Due to its elevated location, the cities below can be seen from the distance. Took several pictures here before leaving  for my next attractions.|Vez A|It was almost a snap decision to spend time in Tops Lookout. We were rewarded with a fantastic view of the city, with a refreshing wind blowing constantly. Although the place needs some sprucing up, we recommend that first time visitors to Cebu take some time to visit this place. It won’t disappoint. A coffee shop would do wonders for guests who’d want to stay a little longer.|Robert W|You must get a gas taxi to go there, not propane. It's a great view, but not much to do after 15 minutes.|Ryan S|This place reminded me of Twin Peakes in San Francisco or the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. Panoramic views for 100 miles or more. I was disappointed that they charged to enter the park when it appeared to be free according to most places. I went in the day time when it was dead and do not regret it. Apparently it is mobbed at night and there is no parking available then, or at least it is insufficient.|Samcebu|Great views of the city got to go in the evenings better for pictures. There are no activities there hard to get to but worth I.|reddogsailor|Excellent Food and a wonderful place to see the sunset over Cebu. Prices are reasonable also. Highly recommend the stuffed Tuna belly.|Wenifer Dawson|When you enjoy nature at nights with a great view of the city lights being peaceful and quiet then you have to check out this place. Friends and families can hang around while having a good chat. There are also good restaurants within the area.|Peewee Rodney S|The place and the view are breathtaking except the rusted roof needs urgent replacement! It is embarrassing when capturing with a drone cam, even with our naked eyes standing on the center or edge of the location. The rot reflects negligence so act fast, please!"

It’s a beautiful place for an afternoon walk. Even though it was hot while we were there , there is plenty of shade to be foundWe had a volunteer tour guide for part of our visit this time. He was filled with information, but delivery was pretty boring and he spent way to long in each section, so after a while I tipped him 300 pesos and we explored on our own. Where the tour guide is really helpful is in the galleries to explain the art pieces, after that I suggest type and go on your own.|Rojo Tapiador|The tour was nice. Entrance Fee: 30 Pesos (Price same for locals and foreigners)It's not as big as intramuros but the ambiance of the colonial era can still be felt. Some locals we're doing photo shoots for debuts.

Overall, happy but not sure if coming back again.|PJB|Visited today30 peso entrance feeWell kept compared to fort Santiago  but smaller however still very impressiveHad a wonderful time soaking it all up|RanjitM|The fort itself is quite compact. a nice walk around which would not be for more than half hour. Ask for the guide, who're usually tourism students that are interning. They shall provide a nice historical background to each element of the Fort, as well a history into the Spanish entry into Cebu.They even have a cannon from one of Magellan's original ship ( i think / or from the first war in the 15th Century)|Simon C|I enjoyed my visit around this ancient fort which is very solidly constructed – some of the walls are well over a metre thick and you can easily visualise how effective a stronghold this was.  There is a tiny entrance fee (20 peso).  A little more information about its heritage and day to day operations would have been very informative.|alwaystravelsf|Pretty cool to see but not that exciting for me.  History buffs might appreciate it more but I didn’t get that excited and it was Hot AF.  Small entrance fee comes with tour guide but I was kinda in a hurry so possibly why I didn’t enjoy it so much.|Ishi Lavador|It was nice to get a glimpse of Cebu's colonial past. The architecture was well-preserved and they even have the canons there. It's surreal that its the oldest fort in the Philippines and it's still around til today. Definitely worth the visit and would definitely go again! :)|Francis Demetri A|Fort San Pedro in Cebu City offers a captivating glimpse into the city's colonial past.

While relatively small in size, it makes up for it with its rich heritage and picturesque surroundings.|Agnes G|We were welcomed by a drum ensemble upon entrance; it felt very grand.

Seeing the view (the harbor and islands) from a different angle made our visit to Fort San Pedro memorable. Together with the band and dancers, they created a nostalgic and lively atmosphere.|Stella B|Fort San Pedro is a historical place located in Cebu City. We went there during our Gabii sa Kabilin event. Although I’ve been in Cebu many times and passed by there, I never got the chance to go inside the place. When my friends and I went there, we got to see old bikes, cannons, and we realized that the area has corals and some parts are made out of egg shells! There were also paintings of past events in Cebu city. It is a nice area to chill and learn about the history of Cebu City and the Philippines.|Anna Angelika S|The area is quite beautiful especially at night. We had a great time there. Our ride on the tartanilla was enjoyable as well.|Alyssa Magno|The museum situated inside the fort's walls was definitely the highlight of the visit.

Its  a beautiful, clean and safe place to go to shop, relax and dine with friends and family.|Mark K|We came here off the 3rd Mactan Cebu Bridge, so close, worth the experience to travel on such a nice bridge and be close to the mall.  This is like any other great SM mall, BUT... they have a skiing rink in a tropical country.  Not the best ice, or skates but worth the fun with my Pinoy niece and nephews.  Make sure to ask for Hockey Stakes, they are more like western skates.|Kozi Tsen|Very big mall in Cebu with a circular floor plan. My main concern is the ATM and toilets. For the ATM, there was a time when ALL of the ATM was not available and no directions posted in the machines as to where else we can find another ATM available. As a result, we have to go around asking other people for help. No computer mall directory. The same with toilets, I don't know why they don't have toilet paper for the comfort of their customers. Sometimes they also run out of handsoap! This is one of the largest mall in the world and yet no toilet paper, no bidet, no handsoap!|extravelagent|Although one of the biggest within the top 10, I like it alot as it's manageable. Chess, archery, great eats, scooters, massage chairs, but most of all it was all walkable within reason! Best of all free a/c bus to Fuente Circle and SM Cebu.Like all other malls it has tons of shopping, cinemas and grocery store. But the free bus was waht I liked as it got me to the circle where my hotel was and totally left on time and was clean. Thumbs up!|Ted C|The mall is so large you will need a full day here, we visited twice in two days, plenty of variety and food outlets (avoid KFC the service is terrible,  Chow king chaotic but ok) the views from this mall alone, makes it worth a visit.

What set it apart was the tablet they will lend you (in my case I was reminded by the guard to get one since I'm halfway already when they noticed I don't have one) which serves as your personal tour guide which is played by one of the residents (reenactment) of the old house.vThe ground floor is air-conditioned and was okay. But going up the 2nd floor, you will get to experience what the early Cebuanos (the rich ones at least) experienced during their time. No Air-conditioning but lots of windows and ways to cool down. I really felt like I was taken back in time every room I enter while playing the appropriate voice and video caption per area of the house. The narration and stories really get me connected to the house as I take every step to every corner. Lastly, my enjoyable visit would not be possible if not for the kind and professional staffs, specially kuya Guard.

The two-story house's construction with stone blocks, hardwood flooring, and treasures inside greatly astounded me. Every time I see those beautiful pieces on exhibit, it takes me on a fascinating voyage through time.

The staff were also very accommodating and there were also some amazing performances of arnis and some Philippine dances as well.|Agnes G|Entering the building felt like we time travelled to hundreds of years ago. The building design wasn't the only thing that was old-fashioned, but also the furniture inside. Equipment used by the country during the old times were displayed, and it was very fascinating to see.|Stella B|Casa Gorordo is a museum located at the heart of Cebu City. We visited the museum during our Gabii sa Kabilin event. There were a lot of people in the museum and yet, the staff handled the crowd professionally as there were lines and a clear area on where to enter and exit the museum. The museum was full of wonderful artifacts, from history to religion, and we really had a great time there. The balcony of the museum feels like we’re living in the past, just like the women in the past waiting for their lovers to make harana. There was also a Bo’s coffee where people could sit and have a good time after visiting. Balik batik was also there and we got to try on filipinianas and take great pictures. All in all, it is indeed a must visit when touring in Cebu City.|Hans Y|To experience going to a museum in casa corordo made feel like going back to the past and learning more about them.|Kiar|The place was beautiful and interesting. I haven't really gone to musuems in Cebu, so this was a great first stop. The artifacts were well preserved and I particularly liked the different dishware and cooking pots. My only problem was the place was really really crowded, but this was more so our problem than the museums. Once we stepped out on to the garden however, the air felt great and the food stalls were tasty. Would definitely go here again.|Sydney G|We weren't able to completely appreciate and explore the museum because there were so many people, but despite the limited time, we were equally as impressed with the artworks. One of the must-see displays was a glow-in-the-dark artwork. In addition, the museum itself was a work of art.

The knowledgeable and passionate staff members were eager to share the stories behind each item, further enriching my understanding of the family's lineage and the significance of the artifacts on display. The museum's commitment to authenticity and preservation was evident throughout. The family's personal belongings, photographs, and letters were carefully curated, providing a personal connection to the past. It was truly remarkable to witness how the museum seamlessly blended historical significance with intimate family stories, creating a profound sense of connection and empathy with the people who once called this house their home.|Faith S|The house was perfectly preserve, leading us into being more intruiged compared to the other exhibitions.

Later the owner who is the son of Julian N. Jumalon came and told us some more about his father and his amazing work. Both were so knowledgeable, answered our questions, and gave us so much information. We saw many caterpillars, pupae, and butterflies before going to see the collection of specimens from around the world and then to the building that houses the art. Lepido mosaic is art made from butterfly wings which is very impressive and beautiful but there is also many paintings. These folks really care about keeping this place going and preserving the life work of Julian N. Jumalon. I would definitely recomend checking it out.|Beatriz F|I first visited Jumalon Butterfly Sanctuary in 2000.  I met the owner Mr. Julian Jumalon. He was 90 years old. I learned about the Sanctuary from his daughter, Dr. Humaida Jumalon who I met at Baha'i Conference at the University in Puerto Princesa. Her father was kind and so knowledgeable about butterflies and moths.  He gave me a tour of his art gallery.  We had tea and wonderful conversation.  It was one of the most peaceful places I visited in the Philippines!!  At that moment, it was difficult to imagine it had been severely destroyed by those who initiated World War II. The suffering seemed so far away. I learned so much from him!  And, I will return again!.|Adrian S|Really worth going - many beautiful butterflies. The manager is very knowledgeable and has lots of stories to tell!|Mr_Biyahero|While in Cebu city I searched best place to visit, and the butterfly sanctuary seemed interesting. My girlfriend and I spent the day roaming Cebu, eventually getting to the sanctuary. Spending time at the sanctuary with Miss Jumalon was such an incredible experience she took us through the sanctuary showing us her extensive butterfly/insect display, showing all the beautiful art and contribution to science her father (Julian Jumalon) made. We learnt a lot and we were lucky enough to have a one on one educational experience with Miss Jumalon. I could not speak more highly of this place and Miss Jumalon herself. One of a kind experience that I am glad to have lived. Hopefully more people discover this gem of Cebu.|Scenic788463|Unfortunately when I went there were not many butterflies. They run an open garden, not one completely enclosed by netting, as many other places do, so the butterflies are free to come and go. Despite this, the lady showing us around (daughter of the founder), was such an amazing source of information. She explained everything about butterflies, caterpillars, their lifecycle, different types of butterfly, etc. I learned a lot and it is always a pleasure to listen to someone who has such a passion for their subject. I definitely recommend this place. The complete tour is around 1hr.|evamH8572HA|The place is not as spectacular one like in Singapore or Thailand. It even has limited parking and very close proximity to small residences. But if you are interested to learn about butterflies species that graced and lived in Cebu City, visit this place.|Leigh K|What a disappointing place...Someone's house, with some butterflies flying around, tour guide was a young girl still at school.After the garden tour you are taken inside the house, 1 room to be exact, and shown different types of butterflies, beetles & other insects which have been preserved in picture frames.Last part of the tour we were taken into the art gallery... well taken into a room with some pictures on the wall.Wouldn't recommend at al..|Non s|I thoroughly enjoyed my visit at the butterfly sanctuary. I do wish I had brought bug spray as the mosquitoes are prevalent in the heavily shrubbed garden for the butterflies. And this is their rainy season as well.  The young man, who is an intern there, gave me my tour. I went on a Sunday morning while everyone was at church so it was basically a private tour as I was the only one there during that time so that was nice.  It is basically like a small home with a large garden that happens to have dozens of butterflies living there.  They keep the caterpillars in an enclosure to allow them to become butterflies so prey does not get to them as many of the butterflies are endangered of becoming extinct. So many already are, with just a few different types left. I went inside after my tour of the garden and was able to meet one of Jumalon’s sons. He was nice and knowledgeable and showed me some more about the work they do there. Much of the art made there is made of old butterfly wings. It’s really quite cool.  I’m not sure small children would enjoy this but it’s great for older kids and adults.  Spent about 45 minutes there.|mary jean N|the place is one of the tourists attractions yet it needs improvement to really attracts visitors. the gift shop is quite outdated and pricey. But their restroom is quite clean.|Anthony L|Was worried when the taxi driver did not know where it was in a small city like Cebu you'd expect them to know. Its really someones house with a large garden. Was a interesting talk on the history of the collection, but there was little for small children to see as there were not many butterfly's.If you have a couple of hours to stare visiting is an option, but make sure you take bug spray for walking round the garden."

I can say that it's worth it once you reach the top, you'll see a beautiful view and the architecture is really admiring but also please respect the rules as it's a place of worship. There's also an assigned police in the area when we went there.|Simon C|This is worth a visit and a climb – its surprisingly steep. Its an impressive building and series of praying areas. Tourists are encouraged to visit but there is very little information about the temple or the religion, the only interaction is with the somewhat authorisation temple helpers holding up signs to ask you to wear a face mask (really?  - and its outdoors when its not legal requirement).   I would have welcomed an explanation of the “kidney beans”, which provides a yes, no, maybe answer to a question you pose, but at first sight, it does seem to be merely an example of probability theory rather than evidence of a higher being.|Chi_Tiff|While I enjoyed my visit, you can see the entire thing in about ten minutes. I wasn’t allowed in the temple itself because I was wearing shorts and my shoulda were exposed, so if you want to enter this is something to be mindful of. It was alright but there are definitely better things to see/spend your money and time on.|DrNBA|This view of Beverly Hills in Cebu is breathtaking! Very nice and clean, quite space to meditate as well.|loo c|Taoist Temple is a popular attraction located in Cebu City, Philippines. It is a beautiful and serene temple that reflects the Taoist philosophy and religion. Here's a detailed review of the temple:The Taoist Temple in Cebu City is a peaceful and contemplative place that offers a glimpse into the Taoist religion and philosophy. The temple was built in 1972 by Cebu's substantial Chinese community, and it is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the city.The temple complex is located in Beverly Hills Subdivision, and it features a beautiful entrance gate that opens up to a flight of stairs leading up to the temple's main courtyard. The stairs are 81 steps long, representing the 81 chapters of the Taoist scriptures.Upon reaching the top, visitors are greeted by a well-maintained and beautifully landscaped courtyard that is filled with symbolic images and sculptures that are significant to the Taoist religion. The temple is ornately decorated with traditional Chinese designs, intricate carvings, and colorful paintings.One of the most significant features of the temple is the ""Wishing Well,"" where visitors can toss two stones into the well while making a wish. If the stones land inside the circle, it is believed that their wishes will come true.Another important attraction is the Dragon's Head and Dragon's Tail, which is said to bring good luck and fortune to visitors who touch them. Visitors must climb the stairs to the temple's main altar to see the beautifully crafted and colorful Taoist deities, such as the ""Thousand-Hand Guanyin"" and the ""Three Pure Ones.""While the temple is open to the public, it is important to respect the temple's rules and customs. Visitors are required to remove their shoes before entering the temple, and they are not allowed to take photos or videos inside the temple's main altar.In terms of the temple's ambiance, the Taoist Temple offers a peaceful and serene atmosphere that is perfect for meditation and reflection. The temple's courtyard is surrounded by lush greenery and offers a panoramic view of the city, making it an ideal spot for nature lovers and photography enthusiasts.The temple is also known for its fortune-telling activities. Visitors can pay for a consultation with a Taoist monk who can predict their future by interpreting the patterns made by a bundle of 50 sticks. While this is an optional activity, it is an interesting and unique experience for those interested in the Taoist religion and its practices.Overall, the Taoist Temple is a fascinating and beautiful attraction in Cebu City that offers visitors a glimpse into the Taoist religion and philosophy. With its intricate architecture, beautiful landscapes, and serene ambiance, the temple is an ideal destination for those seeking spiritual enlightenment, cultural immersion, and a unique travel experience|richj65|A beautiful Oasis on top of the hill.

There is a charge to get in, but very cheap to see the culture!|bklynbubba|Just as beautiful and moving as the basilica, do not pass up a visit to the cathedral, which is right near by. Also enjoy the market around both buildings. Architecture buffs will certainly have their curiosity tested. For the me connection between the Philippines and Mexico is more evident here than that between the Philippines and Spain.|Lani|I was with my family and my mom reminisce the time she was still very young having a picture in the grotto. We did take one at the same spot just to compare, of course, she can't sit down like the original because there are railings already. We attended the Sunday mass and took many pictures to capture its glorious view. Don't miss it when you're visiting the basilica del sto. nino, it's just nearby.|guillermo|One of the most beautiful churches in Cebu City that I have visited at the centre of the old city. The well maintained and clean cathedral shows historical past, blends with the historic community. Best way to place through cab or Grab.

,Cebu City Philippines,,,,619,3.5,,,,,,,Colon Street,Sights & Landmarks, Free ,"alwaystravelsf|Started at Heritage Monument and Yap house and very short walk to Colon Street. Many locals and Hotel doorman said either don’t waste your time or watch out for Pickpockets. No problems with Pickpockets.  Put your phone and wallet in front pocket! I have to disagree if you want to see the daily life of local people.  The sights, smell, food stalls , cheap shopping for locals.  I didn’t even go into the department stores or buy anything other than a Turon from a vendor and a can of beer at 7-11.  Sure I could complain that it’s a waste of time but it’s also interesting to see all the locals going about there day.  It was hot AF, and my feet hurt, but the best thing was taking a white bus back to Cebu IT Park for 20 php, riding with locals and crazy bus driver.  This is why you visit new cities so you can mix in with the locals!!!  Just Do It!|ybo7000|Colon is the oldest  street in cebu. It is a very  busy street where shoppers n people converge.

Would I go back? probably not.|irenevff|colon - a jargon for the human intestines. but in cebu, it is a long street abuzz with people from all walks of life. oh yes, some are even caught jaywalking to reach the other mall across from the one they came. you can see a university along this avenue, banks, markets, schools, hotels, restaurants, commercial outlets, alleys leading to residential houses - everything. must be the busiest street in the entire city.there's even a little monument marking the end/start of the long road.|Zsofia S|Visited here last February and I love how people are busy looking.

Was there on weekday and had a mass starting outside of all places.  So many people attend that they have outdoor structure where parishioners can sit under the bleachers. Basilica was very nice and also go to left side where yiu can walk down long hallway to see the small doll or baby Jesus santo Nino.  Bring a handheld fan if you can as it gets hot .|Waldo Manalang|Bas is a magnificent religious site in Cebu City, Philippines. The basilica holds a significant place in Filipino history as it houses the Santo Niño, a revered Catholic icon and the oldest religious relic in the country. The grand architecture, intricate details, and vibrant atmosphere of the basilica create a powerful and spiritual experience for visitors, making it a must-visit destination for both religious pilgrims and cultural enthusiasts.|M Earl P|This place has incredible energy. We loved it! If you are ever in Cebu, make this your 1st or 2nd stop! Make sure you take time to offer prayers at Magellan's Cross!|ybo7000|Beautiful church. It's less crowded now after the pandemic. One of the top places that tourists visited when they come to cebu.|loo c|The Santo Niño de Cebu is said to have been brought to the Philippines by the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521, and was given as a gift to the wife of Rajah Humabon, the ruler of Cebu at the time. The statue was later rediscovered by Spanish conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi in 1565, and was enshrined in the church that would later become the Basilica del Santo Niño.|jajavalB|I went here in the 3rd weekend of January where sinulog2023 coming back on street performance and street dance at the new venue of SRP cebu city.

A nice walking distance all other historic spots and feel warm feelings inside|Reslimpan|Interesting to visit and see. It has historical significance. I realize I need to study more about Philippines history prior to the arrival of Magellan. It appears to me that the Philippines didn’t really exist until the catholics arrived, that just don’t feel right. The basilica among the worldwide population of such buildings are average at best.|thefilipinotraveler|This is the oldest church in the country so it has a lot of history including having the oldest religious image (image of Sto. Nino de Cebu). As a Roman Catholic, I have visited it a few times and would really recommend it to other Christians.|Ricoy|Everytime I go to Cebu for business or pleasure, I always try to drop by the Basilica to say my prayers of gratitude to the Mahal na Sto.Nino. For his bountiful blessings and for taking good care for me and my family.|lovehols|Well worth visiting. The doll-like image of Jesus is there to see. It's as old as Magellan, dating back to 1521.

This church is very rich with history and cultural heritage.|lara|I went here with my mother. I can say that it was a very beautiful memory to cherish because churches, especially like the Basilica del Santo Nino, which is a part of our history as well way back the colonization of the Spaniards, have different hit in my heart, considering how well maintained and beautiful it was when I got there inside and out, and it is still has its beauty up until today for sure. I enjoyed exploring the façade of the church and how it looks incredibly great inside. All in all the experience was great, I hope I could visit the Basilica again soon.|London-Phil|As there are many such reviews on the Basilica del Santo Nino here on TA, I thought I might offer a slightly different perspective on such a well visited subject. I visited the Basilica del Santo Nino whilst in Cebu in March 2020, when everything was still open thankfully so I was able to walk freely around.It is certainly impressive, especially when viewed in the context of the poverty of the docks/piers which are but a short stroll away. I know this, because I spent hours walking through both on the day I visited. I am used to poverty overseas, but found the very young girls (children), clearly with their own young babies, especially upsetting. I make this observation only because of the very visible difference between the prosperity of the two factions, and not as a specific criticism of either.   The Basilica del Santo Nino, is a beautiful Catholic Church, located in the downtown area of Cebu City, next to the Magellan Cross which, is another highly visited tourist point. As is usual for me, the most compelling and therefore memorable aspect of my visit was the human interaction enjoyed, this rather than the glitz and glory of the main building itself.I remember well, a smiley Lady of some advanced years, in yellow (see pics), attempting to sell me some candles. Unfortunately, I had just purchased a large, Holy candle from the Church shop, this for a friend back in the UK who is considerably more devout than I am. So sadly in this case, I felt unable to accommodate her request to buy more.I did however ask, if she might like to come home to the UK with me as I was both alone abroad and sadly, unloved at home. Alas, she broke my heart and we subsequently parted with the cheeriest of laughs and giggles being exchanged between us. The point I'm really trying to make here is a simple one. Yes, the building is beautiful and clearly, religiously significant. I am myself a Catholic who studied theology when younger. The real beauty for me however, will always be the people who inhabit and visit these sites rather than the bricks, mortar and Gold in this instance, that was required to build them. Over the years, I have been to many such Grand Places of Worship, and the thoughts and memories that have lingered the longest, have always been centred around conversations enjoyed whilst there, rather than the Grandeur of the places themselves. In which case, if ever given the opportunity, go and explore the Basilica del Santo Nino and enjoy the beauty that is self-evident from near every corner and angle. Above all else though, bring some money for the truly lovely Lady in yellow, as I have absolutely no doubt, she will still be there and asking if you might buy her candles. Remember to smile when you speak, as you just never know where the next life affirming conversation will come from, even when you don't actually speak the same language. That for me, is the true beauty and wonder, of Travel! As always, happy and safe travelling. Phil|Francis_Elvis_Verdin|A Place that you could remember the resemblance of how we invade by Spaniards the Philippines for almost 333 years.|ScambusterSZ|While we couldn't get in, we had a nice walk around as part of longer walk around the village. It between the main drag through town and the ocean front. You can also see the museum nearby.|Roger M|A beautiful place in which to contemplate your inner self. Can never visit Cebu without spending a few minutes in this holy place."
