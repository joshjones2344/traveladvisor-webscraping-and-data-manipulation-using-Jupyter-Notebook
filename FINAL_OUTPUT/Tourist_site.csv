University of San Carlos Museum,Museums, Free ,"Pelaez Street University of San Carlos, Cebu City 6000 Philippines",236,4.5,"Alexia T|The university museum is beautifully in order arranged. The museum has exhibits like Saint exhibits, chinaware, and old swords..|Francis Demetri A|The museum's collection lacks depth and fails to provide a cohesive narrative. The artworks on display are limited and lack notable pieces that would captivate art enthusiasts. The artifacts, while representing different periods, lack proper contextualization, leaving visitors confused about their significance.|Shiloah Brook M|The museum offered a captivating experience with its extensive collection of interesting artifacts and pieces. Visitors were engaged through interactive activities, such as the paint wall, which added a creative dimension to the visit. Although not as accessible as other museums, likely due to its affiliation with a school, the museum's hidden location added to its charm and exclusivity. Despite the slight challenge in finding it, the effort was well worth it for the unique and diverse cultural heritage showcased within. Overall, this museum is a must-visit for those seeking to uncover hidden gems and embark on a delightful journey through history and art.|Unoh Borbajo|The museum's displays cover a diverse range of topics, including anthropology, natural history, fine arts, and archaeology. Visitors can view historic artifacts, including ceramics, utensils, and jewelry, which provide a peek into the Philippines' pre-colonial history. Additionally, there are works of religious art and colonial-era art in the collection that demonstrate the impact of Spanish colonization on the local artistic traditions.Also, I loved that we were able to visit the University of San Carlos - Main Campus as me and my friends who visited are Carolinians that study at Talamban Campus. It was great to know our institution offers this kind of experience where we would be taken back in time and learn more about the world around us.|Tristan Ybanez|Thanks to our school requirement, I recently had the pleasure of visiting a museum. and I must say the experience was truly fascinating and enlightening. From the moment I entered, I was transported to a world of history, art and culture. The museum was like no other, It was well lit, clean, and modern. and as much as I hate to admit it, but I really am not a fan of museums, however, This museum was just inviting me to indulge in the history, and learn. I left the museum in awe and inspiration! I wholeheartedly recommend visiting this musem|Isabella M|The exhibits themselves were interesting but the highlight was definitely the collection of old saint figures. The venue itself is clean, well-lit, and modern looking compared to the anthropological and animal exhibit. There is a wide array of items to look at so it feels worth the relatively cheap price, even better if you are a USC student as admission is free.|Romar John C|The museum has its modern approach in displaying significant relics, artifacts, and even organisms in the rich history of the Philippines.|Tel G|Overall, the establishment was well kept and the artifacts are well maintained with corresponding labels so if you didn’t have anyone to walk you through the museum you could still immerse yourself by reading those attachments.|Joel V|As a Carolinian myself, I was able to enjoy the museum visit. It was the first time I was able to go and I appreciate USC very much that they were able to hold such treasures and heritage. As a Filipino youth, I was able to take myself back in the past from the precolonial, indigenous roots to the more contemporary. USC upholds the importance of history and that is shown how the museum is well-curated. I loved the experience as it made me realize the significance of honoring the Filipino roots from the preserved wares for daily living, religious artifacts during the colonial period, to indigenous materials and heritage, revolutionary traditions, and even the fauna of the Philippine wild. It was a very insightful, amusing experience.|Ly G|The place has so much displays that tells a lot about the history of the Philippines, particularly its ethnic people and their lives, some ancient displays of Christian symbols as well as some of the ancient fauna found in the Philippines and across worldwide."
Cebu Heritage Monument,Sights & Landmarks, Free ,"Colon Street, Parian Plaza, Cebu City 6000 Philippines",332,4.0,"alwaystravelsf|Someone recommended seeing this Monument and Yap house a stones throw away.  Great place to start sightseeing of area.  Didn’t do any research previously,  but was fascinated by the size and the characters depicted.  They look like bad ass Warriors and I was the only one there .  Only about 5 minutes to look at and then make your way to Yap house!|Yann|The Cebu Heritage Monument is impressive and offers a rich insight into the history and culture of Cebu. The intricate sculptures beautifully depict key events and personalities in Cebu's past. The monument's location in the heart of the city makes it easily accessible for visitors. However, it can get crowded at times, limiting the opportunity for a peaceful and immersive experience. Nonetheless, it remains a must-visit attraction for anyone interested in Cebu's heritage.|loo c|The Cebu Heritage Monument is a stunning sculpture and a must-see attraction in Cebu City. The monument depicts important historical events and figures in the city's history, from the arrival of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan to the Battle of Mactan. The intricate details of the sculpture and the use of lighting make it a beautiful sight to behold at night. The monument also features a fountain and a small park, providing a relaxing and picturesque spot for visitors. The monument's location in the city center makes it easily accessible and a perfect addition to any itinerary exploring the city's rich history and culture.|Czar Emmanuel|This monument depicts important scenes from Philippine history, particularly with reference to the Christianization of the country. It is located in the Parian district of Cebu City (right across the famous Yap-Sandiego ancestral house), specifically in a plaza of an old church that has been demolished and now a fire station stands in it. The monument is quite imposing. However, some pieces of it are beginning to crumble. I wish the local government would do something about it.|uzmelissa|This monument tells us very detailed information about Cebu history and Magellan's factor. A great architecture and amazing point, it deserves taking some pic tures with it.|Oscardog16|Free to enter, not crowdered and well worth a look.  Don't need a guide if you have read a small amount of the Cebu history.  It is within walking distance of most tourist sites in old Cebu.|Reslimpan|Very interesting monument depicting Cebu’s history from Magellan’s arrival, I am sure they had a history before that but no sign of that. That doesn’t make the artwork less interesting, beautiful statues, impressive work. All the information about the monument is no longer there, thus having a guide is helpful. Outside of the monument some touts pushing pearls and other “jewelry”|richj65|Nice place to start and get great photos of a interesting monument.  Otherwise there is nothing else to see at this location.|extravelagent|....only because it's at the end of Colon street and a bit out of the way. It's a cool monument but it's a bit of a hike down Colon street- and then ahve to walk back. If you in a car it's ok but to walk a bit too much.|Irish Mae|The place is tidy and well maintained.  As per guide, the sculptures represent the important event or history of Cebu. It is right in front of yap ancestral house.Nothing much to say since we just stayed 10 minutes.|irenevff|you will really take a second look if you happen to pass by this sculpture at the middle of a busy street. it has numerous figures that kinda depict cebu's rich history. one will see magellan's cross & galleon, lapu-lapu, sergio osmeña, san pedro calungsod & other historical images that represent cebu's past which made it the strongest city in the visayas.its worse feature is the spot it stands on. you might get hurt from passing motorists  if you attempt to scrutinize the monument much closer.|Marty|Impressive , overly large Cebu Heritage MonumentFrom ever angle , you can interestingly see a difference historical aspect of Cebu’s history The Cebu History depicted in the Heritage Monument is  ...• The Magellan’s Cross• Saint John the Baptist Church• A Spanish Galleon• Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral• Basilica del Santo NiñoThe interesting scenes depicted in the Heritage Monument are ...• The Battle of Mactan - between Lapu-Lapu & Ferdinand Magellan• A Roman Catholic mass• The Baptism of Rajah Humabon• A procession of the Santo NiñoThe persons depicted in the monument include the late president Sergio Osmena Sr. & Blessed Pedro CalungsodThe Cebu Heritage Monument ... is a must see , if visiting Cebu City Myself I’ve visited well over 8 Times , as you see something different each time Free to view Quick walking distance from Cebu’s Yap-Sandiego Ancestral House & Jesuit House Museum Taxi’s pass bye regularly ... as is located near the busy downtown - Colon Street|LolaGo1|Located at the middle of a very busy street, this attraction is easy to locate. The sculptures depict the history of Cebu .Note that nearby is located another attraction called, 1730 Jesuit House.|NPLim|The monument is filled with Stone carvings that describe each events that took place from our rich past. You will be welcomed by a caretaker who is full of wits. You will enjoy hearing stories straight from him. My kids appreciated everything we listed to. No fees here needed to walk around. But you can also be generous to Tip the caretaker who is passionate about his story telling and not to discount his sincerity to make you understand how the past happened.|Faithalicious_x|This monument is only really worth seeing if you are already in the area - ie you are visiting either Yap Santiego or Casa Goroado. It really is just a large statue and isn’t worth travelling to for itself alone. At least it’s free!|Joshua Trimidal|I must say that this monument is very breathtaking for me. It is a beautiful reminder of Philippine history. The original Philippine house is also nearby. About 20 meters from this monument. This monument is free and you can take pictures here. Beware of local kids who offer fake jewelry. Keep everything hidden. It often happens that they reach into pants pants. The Philippines is one of the most beautiful areas in the world, but all the more you have to take care of your safety. Use grab to move. You can pay by cash or by card. For more information, feel free to write.|ShekouJon|It’s like a story book of Philippine history.  Don’t forget to check out the ancestry home nearby. Very cool.|Kimdelro|Took a cab from my hotel to Yap-Sandiego Ancestral house. The house was indeed very old but small. 2 storey house you will explore antique and some art works back in the day. Has a 50 pesos entrance fee and a tour guide will walk you through. After this you can head out to the monument just in front of it, which I must say was massive and impressive for me. Must see around 4pm so the photo lighting wjll be good. From here I walked to the Jesuit house just a block away. This is a much bigger house- again filled with antiquities and history. Has a 50 pesos entrance again with a tour guide. I enjoyed this better than the Yap-Sandiego ancestral house. From here you can walk to the Sto. Niño Church and Magellans Cross. Then last stop is the Fort San Pedro where you can rest with good breeze and sunset. All can be done in 3hrs steady pace.|Poor guide|If you wanted to visit jesuit, yap ancestral and gorordo this is where you should go. google map it.. no need to hire a tour guide to see these places.|Adrian I|Nice but nothing special. It's enough 10 minutes to visit this monument. Be careful on the streets for the pick pockets"
1730 Jesuit House,Sights & Landmarks, ₱50.00 ,"Zulueta Street Parian, Cebu City 6000 Philippines",179,4.5,"Florida_family_kids|One of the original buildings for this area by the church very interesting Architect, an original ceilings, walls and floors|Jeah20|It was an amazing experience, seeing the antiques are more expensive than my wallet, and the atmosphere made me feel more like I'm really in the past.|Francheska C|This hidden gem provided a captivating journey through history, and I was enthralled by the well-preserved artifacts and exhibits. The people who take care of the place were incredibly accommodating, making the experience even more enjoyable.|Alyssa Magno|It was an experience to visit here as the meticulous restoration efforts have maintained its original structure, allowing visitors like me to step into the past and gain a deeper understanding of Cebu's history. I wished that there was signage around the area because the location was quite hard to precisely locate. Regardless, I had a great time here|Faith S|A great site to learn about history, art, and culture can be found here. As you explore the exhibits and discover more about the things on show, a museum visit can be both informative and pleasant. It was an incredible experience, and I also learned about Cebu's history in addition to that of the Philippines. Our trip is definitely worthwhile.|Czanine J|I recently had a pleasure of visiting the Jesuit house during Gabii sa Kabilin 2023, and it was an absolute delight. The heritage house offers a fascinating glimpse into the city’s colonial past, providing us with a rich and immersive experience. There was also a live harp playing in the background which added to the nice vibe.|Rigil Kent Manatad|What impressed me most about the 1730 Jesuit House was its commitment to preserving history. The meticulous restoration work carried out on the house is evident in every detail, allowing visitors to truly appreciate the authenticity and charm of the original structure. It's a testament to the dedication and passion of the individuals involved in maintaining this cultural landmark. The interior of the Jesuit House is a treasure trove of artifacts and antiques. Each room showcases different aspects of Cebu's past, including religious relics, household items, and furniture from various periods. Walking through the rooms felt like stepping into a different era, with each item telling a unique story of the people who once inhabited the house.|SofiaB|The Jesuit House was an interesting visit. The house was able to preserve its vintage quality. We were able to learn about its history through the photos posted on its walls and the information given to us by the stationed guides. I also liked viewing the vintage items and artifacts that were on display. Lastly, I enjoyed listening to the harp performer present at the time.|Trisha Rebayla|The 1730 Jesuit House is certainly a hidden treasure within Parian. I noticed that the museum had areas which were still under construction. Despite that, the staff were quite welcoming with their sunny disposition and warm greetings as my friends and I entered the site. I would like to add that having free ice cream to end the museum tour was a brilliant idea! It was a humid night and it really helped cool us down.Although the whole concept of being a ""hidden treasure"" is great, I would recommend having 2-3 people from the staff accommodate guests from the outside (preferably where you could see traffic - the kind where there are people walking along the street) and not just from the registration area. My friends and I had difficulty finding the museum because of how mysterious it looked when in reality, we actually passed by the area at one point and did not even realize that it was a museum that was part of Gabii sa Kabilin 2023.I also suggest to improve the lighting from the outside because the street where the museum is located was quite dark which made my friends and I hesitant to go along that part of the road.Regardless, we have learned so much being inside the museum. It was like revisiting history all over again as we looked at the furniture, the infrastructure as a whole, and of course, the artifacts which were housed within the museum.Good luck on your future events! I hope to see you guys again the next time there'll be another GSK!|Nicole D|Although the museum have some parts under construction, the staffs are really accommodating and I can really now understand why is it called ""a secret museum"" because at first glance you won't know it's a museum because it is used as a hardware warehouse but inside lies an old house well maintained by the people who works there.|Reann G|Love the airconditioned place. Every relic found inside were amazing to see and I feel like it really shows an important part of what our history really looked like. Also, loved how they gave out free icecream after finishing the whole house [I think it was because of the GSK happening too] 🤘|Quevyn Adjutor Abuzo|As one of the oldest houses in Cebu/in the country, the place is a history lesson of Cebu... incarnate. Considering a coin was found buried in the house that dated back to the Ming Dynasty, one is surely left baffled on how an infrastructure older than their greatest, greater, great grandparents continues to stand on its ground.|Czar Emmanuel|Along with the nearby Yap-Sandiego ancestral house, this old Jesuit house, tucked inside a Chinese hardware, is considered as one of the oldest houses in the Philippines. An inscription inside the house dates its construction to the year 1730. Historical records say that it was formerly used as Jesuit house or one of its mission houses. Inside you'll be accompanied by a tour guide who will tell you about its history and guide you through its various rooms.|Xerxes R|Read about this place on trip advisor and am def happy we visted. A  charge of 50pesos is negligible for this slice of history. Our guide was informative and explained in detail also answering our questions with patience and interest. Def give this a VISIT have a blast.|LolaGo1|I had a difficult time finding local transport from Independence Park to the Sugbo Museum,My “Angkas” driver erroneously took me here. Entrance fee is 50 pesos. There is a very busy hardware selling panels of metals located in front of this house.The house is authentic, its living areas such as bedroom, living room, kitchen, reception area, etc are still intact. Also on display are some artifacts found underground,  maps, pictures, etc.Suggestion: Separate the Hardware from this attraction. It was very dusty here during my visit!|Dkkeeling|Not a lot to see or spend a lot of time overInteresting with the Spanish heritage and some relics interesting|jem2811|Very interesting, considering that not all are aware of it. Even a nearby resident has admitted to be unaware of this. Not as “popular” other museums within the Parian District probably because of its unimpressive tarpaulin sign and it being “buried” in the midst of a hardware of its 3rd owner. Displays and galleries are well organized that its indeed a travel through time capsules.   Length of visit is dependent on whether one wants to read al the write ups.  Photography is allowed, unlike in museums in other parts of the country. It is actually the oldest recorded house in Cebu City, with the year of construction above the original main entrance. (Unfortunately my photo files are too large for posting. I have however uploaded them in the page Ancestral Houses in the Philippines and Advocates for Heritage Preservation on FB)|Poor guide|Google map it. It will cosr you 2 u.s dollars or less.. they provide you an english tour guide, they are very accomodating.. then you get to meet the owner who is very hospitable. Its just across the cebu heritage monument.|Andrew P|Unique Museum in the heart of Cebu. Nestle in the middle of a hardware store. One of the most interesting museums I have visited. Very informative about the history of Cebu.|travel_lusting|We did go here and found it interesting to look around.  Unfortunately, we were here on a tour.  I would not pay a tour guide just for a look around here.  Worth going if you can make it here on your own."
Sumilon Island,Nature & Parks, ₱50.00 ,Philippines,297,4.0,"Tibor A|30x3m long beach, without an option to see the inner part of the island without paying 2000-2500p fir the resirt part. We were there on Saturday when it was crowded with tourists. U can not buy anything on the beach, There is almost no shadow where u can sit not to get sunburned. The transport for 4 people was 1200p and 100p per head for environment. Waste of money and time.|Shaz E|We didn't have any tours booked as we wanted to explore on our own, but once we walked up the stairs for a bit (from the sandbar) and that was it. It was high tide so we couldn't sunbake. We snorkeled for a bit but the swell was bad.The package fee to get into the resort was like 2000peso or 2500 peso. The locals will try to rip you off for the price of the tuk tuk and boat trip. The starting price is 1000peso.  Overall, I didn't enjoy my time here and I honestly would give it a miss.|Paiis|Isn’t what is advertised at all! We expected a large beach area with a swimming area (the sea) instead we got there and we’ll there was steps up the island which you couldn’t go further as that was the resort and a mass amount of people sitting on the rocks as there was no beach area! Very poor.. we paid 1000php per person and it was a completely waste of money. We were told we could come back any time before 6pm and we were then told we had to leave at 3pm as that was the last boat. Because there wasn’t many people left waiting for boats. We’d have liked to see the sunset at least but we couldn’t. I wouldn’t recommend unless you stay at the resort.|uzmelissa|Sumilon island is a good choice to have rest and enjoy with sandy beach and perfect sea. The resort is well equipped for half day tour activities enough. Easy to reach and a good escape|paulatraveladdict|Not a relax exclusive place. Staff very friendly but not good management. Already had bad experience blue water resort macrame and here the same. A lot of day people making a lot of noise under plastic tents. Marked swimming place with big boat in front making a lot of noise. No drinks after 21.00, no minibar, they don’t allow drinks from Cebu. No cushion on beds, not relax. Restaurant is nice but no good food. Only pizza (they ran out of pizza first night), burger en Filipino food (which we had before so much better for so much less). No seafood… no bar. No daily cleaning. Over crowded beach. If you want a nice place go to the atmosphere resort in Dauin. Prices same but 10 times better!|Evelin M|It’s just a small sandbar with a bunch of seashells that makes it uncomfortable to walk. The typhoon affected the sandbar so it doesn’t look like the picture anymore. We did some snorkeling and it was ok but then we saw jellyfish and got out of the water. Overall, it was not worth going. The best part was pictures of the island from the boat ride.|Mandina81|Nothing to say but... Amazing! like literaly! So much fun and nature activities in here. Peaceful, clean and had a friendly staff. We're excited to post our group and of course each solo pictures! Amazing Cebu!|nitajuana|3 hours drive from Cebu City. When you reach the docking area you will check-in and they will give you an orientation - protocols, but no room keys yet. 10 minutes boat trip to the island. No fancy greetings, you have to walk all the way to their other check-in counter, where keys will be given when available.  Note: NOT a good place for elderly or PWD, lots of walking and stairs climbing. They have a golf cart that runs only up to 4pm, after that you have to walk from sand bar back to your room, a good 10 minute walk. They do not provide maps, so you have to navigate by yourself. The lagoon was pretty, but no one was on standby to help us there. Food was ok, during breakfast limited choices, no cereals for kids. Rooms are big but television and telephone is not working.The island is beautiful, serene but they can improve more on their service and amenities.|Pio|i was with my coworkers here very beautiful island and we have a peaceful vacation here . .i highly recommend this place .|MJ Tups|Good day, I would like to ask if there is a hotel nearby Tan-awan Oslob Cebu, accomodating for boat rent in going to Sumilon island? How much is the boat rent if there is?"
Temple of Leah,Sights & Landmarks, ₱50.00 ,"Roosevelt Street Busay, Cebu City 6000 Philippines",610,3.5,"justinejanejj|The complex is massive. The temple is average sized, but the ceiling is high. It offers a good view of the city. Everything about this place is opulent. Can be a quick visit, since there’s not much to do.|burghughes|The Temple of Leah is an impressive structure and a great place to take photos. Beyond that there really isn’t much to see/do here. We went earlier in the day, leaving central Cebu City about 9:30 AM. When we arrived it was not crowded, but when we left there was already a long line of cars to enter. There was a very talented singer in the lobby area and speakers carried his music throughout the site. Besides the view, that was probably what I enjoyed the most|Mississippi Analytics|That place is seriously something else. It's like someone took a chunk of ancient Greece and plopped it right in the Philippines. The grandeur is next-level, and the views? Total jaw-droppers. But, here comes the curveball – the trek up. If you're not exactly a fan of uphill hikes, well, brace yourself. The road to Temple of Leah is a bit like a mini workout session. I mean, the views are kind of the reward, but you might be huffing and puffing your way up there.|Cadie H|It is a beautiful site. The inside is closed off, so only the outside to visit. Weekend price is 150 for adults. The cafe has nice desserts, there is a restaurant but we did not eat there|YuppieLionheart|It's my second time to go here. In 2022, you can't do a lot here, just admiring the view, take pictures and that's it. But this May 2023, when we visited the place, the first thing I noticed is their entrance fee increased but they give discounts to senior citizens and there's a restaurant inside so the visitors can now dine after striking a pose. It's an elegant restaurant so a perfect place to have a romantic date with special someone. The restroom hallways is also nice, you'll get a feel of luxury.|Simon C|It’s a fine line between an example of conspicuous consumption and a mega display of wealth, or a magnificent work of art. As the owner said himself, “I cut off the top of the mountain” to build a palace inspired by the Parthenon in Greece in honour of his (still living) wife.  The building had plenty of marble and its makes for a good instagram picture, but really, what’s it for given it has four floors and about 12 rooms per floor, some of which are not quite finished and appear uninhabited.I understand that owner made his fortune in property and five years ago, the entrance fee was 50 peso, with seniors and children free.  Now it’s more than doubled to 120 peso for adults with a concessionary price for others. Not quite sure if this is to recover the cost or to pay the singer who adds ambience and character to what otherwise could be, unintentionally perhaps,  a shrine.|Chi_Tiff|I absolutely love my experience here. I’m not sure if it happens all the time, but the day I went there was a violinist paying music there. It created a great vibe!! The views were spectacular and I arrived just before sunset. I’d definitely recommend this place. A guy took me on his motorbike for 500 pesos from the Taosist Temple, waited while I took my photos and hung out and then drove me back to my hostel!  Another driver tried to charge me 1500 for the same trip so definitely beware of being taken advantage of!|Alleonah Patric... C|The view and place is very nice, you can see that the husband who really adored his wife so much! However, the place is still under construction like the basement and the behind part.. the entrance fee is too expensive tho for only seeing the front and the view.. we wanted to see the things inside but it was locked up and we. An only see from outside through the window only. We do hope the next time we visit we can definitely come inside and see everything not just the statues and the view|penelope j|The temple was created by one of the richest husband in Cebu for his wife, obviously. From a far it was ominous, and you expected more. The place however, is not accessible for what it was advertising .It tells the story of a wife who was loving and loves to collect “nice stuff. All of these “nice stuff “ are all locked up. You will not be able to see it, you will be disappointed because you were charged an entrance fee, and you expected more.|Aurora_Nomad|To be honest, and with all due respect to the memory of the lady, the place is a tasteless imitation of European palaces. There was innovation going on at the time of my visit, but to me the visit was really not worth it.|Czar Emmanuel|The first time I visited this place, its basement was still under construction. Well, even up to now its rooms, where some art collections of the Albano-Adarna family are supposed to be on display, are still under construction and closed to the public. However, there have been some notable changes. There's a restaurant now in the basement and entrance to the temple is no longer free. I also noticed that more people were visiting the place, turning this once private family mausoleum into one of Cebu City's tourist destinations. There's also more traffic, with a long queue of cars waiting to find a slot for a  pay.|richj65|It's clearly Greek inspired but it has a Filipino twist. Perfect combination from the structures  the view and the pleasant environment. Good place to relax.|Brix510|This place was very well made and erected as a dedication of love to leah.  However the upkeep is pretty much non existent and it's sad to see the current state - but even with minimal upkeep its very nice|penasihatperjalanan|This location is a wedding venue that is partially open as a tourist trap. Most of the interior is closed and tourists are only permitted outside on the large scenic veranda and inside beneath the domed entry area. There's nothing to do here except to pose beside the statues, with a backdrop of structures of architectural interest or a view of the city far below. If you had to choose between views or talking selfies here or the nearby The Tops, there's little difference and there's no reason to visit both.|aaddelgado|Massive structure but not much to see inside. Not much to do. Still incomplete. View is nice. There were a lot of people visiting. Parking is available. Overall, the entrance fee of Php100 is too pricey.|Kristine R|Before our Cebu trip in May 2022, I have never heard about the Temple of Leah. We only learned about the place thru the cab driver who took us to our hotel from the Mactan Airport upon our arrival. We arranged a city tour with the driver the next day, and voila! We were on our way to the temple, which was perched high up in the mountainous part of Cebu City. The Temple was named after the late Leah Albino-Adarna, the grandmother of Filipino starlet Ellen Adarna. Because of its location, the temple offers a breathtaking view of Cebu City, and inevitably gives visitors a feeling that they are abroad due to the Greek-inspired architecture. The place is good for taking pictures, and gives a glimpse of the grandmother’s collection of jars, liquor bottles, and other ornaments. The Temple of Leah is one of Cebu City’s must-see attractions that will be enjoyed by tourists of all ages.|TengCorrea|Dubbed as Cebu's Taj Mahal, this majestic structure is dedicated by a husband to his late wife. Its lies in the details as in its giant pillars, intricately designed staircase and high golden ceiling. Place also houses various items collected from wife's travels. It's not open when I visited but you can peek through the windows to have a look.Located 45 mins from the city center, one can take habal-habal in front of JY Square Mall. I got mine for Php400 which includes visits to Sirao Pictorial Garden and the newly opened Little Kyoto.Entrance fee at Php100. There's a snack and souvenir kiosk right by the plaza area. Without having to buy anything though, you can sit in one of their huts. There's a view of the city from there. My driver said it's not the same but almost close to view at Tops, another tourist attraction in area.|jakebojorque|Definitely a place worth visiting. Situated up the hills of busay. With a breathtaking view of the city.|Sazeena N|Beautiful place with a great view of the city. It is very touching to know the story behind of this temple. It is beautifully architected at a very good location. Entrance for this place is free and need to be very patient to get a good shot. Well I do recommend people to go there, witness and enjoy exploring more stories of that city.|Francis_Elvis_Verdin|Built-in 2012, this elaborate Roman-style temple is dedicated to Leah Villa Albino-Adarna. It has a breathtaking overlooking of Cebu."
Sirao Flower Garden,Nature & Parks, ₱50.00 ,"Busay, Cebu City 6000 Philippines",276,4.0,"Ina I|its a nice instagrammable place to visit, and about 20min away from marco polo hotel. there are no public transpo available in the area, so what I did (as recommended by the hotel staff!) was to hire a taxi to take us to sirao and take us back to hotel. overall, good experience!|YuppieLionheart|Travel time from Cebu City is less than one hour, the road to Sirao is quite challenging so that's another thrill. The entrance fee is 70 Pesos (As of May 2023). Expect a crowd and patience is a virtue if you want to have a picture with the famous golden hand. Actually, there's four of it. There are two huge golden hands, and two small ones. Since the line is quite long for the huge golden hands, I decided to just take a picture with the small ones as we still have another destination that day. I stood in line for almost 20 mins and yet, I'm not even close. Some takes more than 10 minutes in taking pictures. So imagine that? More than 10 minutes per person. During our time, most of the visitors are foreign, you can count with your hands how many are the Filipinos in line. I highly suggest that you make this as your last destination so you can spend all the time here and you won't have to hurry because you still have another place to go but it would be much better if there's someone who facilitates to ensure that a guest won't spend too much time to consider also there are a lot of other guests waiting for their turn. Also, there's a restroom in the area but in the far end of the garden. Before you exit, you can buy some souvenirs. Outside the garden, you can try out the smoked banana cue, buko juice and other meriendas available.|Len Mian|This garden also nicknamed the Amsterdam of Cebu, is an Instagram paradise.   Very nice views and flowers in the high country.  Lots of elevation climbing by car to get to this spot.  The trip is worth it.|DrNBA|One of the most beautiful views in Cebu! This Garden was filled with wonderfully bloomed flowers, areas to take pictures and most important, the mountains! Great creation on the mountainside!|joycehehe|A long drive from Mactan- more than 1hr. View is beautiful with fresh flowers. However, hard to walk to. Place is not accessible at all via wheel chair and is not senior-citizen friendly at all.Still worth the long drive for me. Very picturesque. Suggest to go early morning or late afternoon because the place has no shade at all.|penelope j|Beautiful flowers and set up. However, the place was not accessible. It’s a bit of a drive from the city of Cebu. The road was a little bit treacherous going there, requiring you to have a great driver. Some areas are a bit rundown. All in all the experience was good.|Aurora_Nomad|Visited with co-workers, and thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful garden, and plenty of opportunities to take memorable photos (some are cheesy, but the hands snd some other ones were enjoyable). It is a drive from Cebu city (took us some 40mins), but we all liked it. Fun fact: check out the Mickey Mouse fruit (not edible, but fun looking).|Sharon Rogers|This will always be such a wonderful memory of my trip to the Phillipines. So cleverly put together, gorgeous views and the gardens tendered to so beautifully. The sculptures the whole experience is not to miss 12 out of 10 from me. Definately worth the visit.🙏❤️|Chevy|Perfect venue for pictorial. All the spots are eye candy and amazing to capture that will contribute to making a memorable experience.|Irish Mae|we are a bit disappointed when we went there since there are less flowers due to typhoon odette, We did not able to experience and see the beautiful scenery of siarao garden based on pictures. But it is understandable due to typhoon odette.We will be back here this coming March or April, and as per our tour agency, this is the perfect time to grow back the flowers.|TengCorrea|I learned this just now but apparently, there are two Sirao gardens in Cebu and this one is for Sirao Pictorial Garden and Camping Site (PGCS). It's a small place. where there are several structures where one can pose for photos against lovely beautiful mountainous backdrop. Most famous of which are the giant hands. There are some flower beds as well. If you're worried about the heat, there are huts or shaded areas where you can rest for a bit. Located about 45mins fr Cebu City, one can take habal-habal from in front of JY Square Mall. You can negotiate but got mine for Php400. There's an additional fee if driver to come in and take your photos. Other sites to visit near area are Temple of Leah, Tops and Little Kyoto. Best to come in the morning because around noon, it can get crowded that people take turns with the more popular pictorial sites. Entrance fee at 60 pesos. There's a small shop near the entrance that sells drinks and snacks as well as souvenirs. Note though that they don't allow visitors to bring water bottles inside.|Junlen Antonio|When my family and I decided to visit Cebu we started looking for some attractions to visit then we stumbled upon a post about Sirao Garden. The photos are just so beautiful and so we made sure to check out the place and it is indeed beautiful. The flowers are so colorful it’s like it would make you feel so happy inside by seeing those vibrant colors. The view is so breathtaking as well I couldn’t help but appreciate and stare at it because it is just so peaceful. I am just so happy that my family and I visited this place and we would surely go back soon.|irenevff|because of the pandemic, i find it fortunate that there was not a crowd flocking this garden in the mountainous area of the city. it was a splendid sight showcasing plants and flowers of various colors with a little feel of amsterdam. the windmills are an eye candy. smelling the flora is effortless. the sweet scents emanating from the flowers can reach your nostrils even when you are wearing face mask & shields. there was strictly a 'no touch' sign in every corner for the safety of both plants and guests.for a measly fee of Php60, you can have the entire garden for yourself, for as long as you would want to stay.|Sazeena N|Very pretty place with a view. The theme of the garden is as the name says, Amsterdam. I loved the miniatures, view and the garden itself. It can be crowded as it is a good place for photographers, Instagrammers, selfie takers.|Nico Samneil Sy Salado|Place not yet fully developed but are already charging php100 for an entrance. If you are flower/plant lover then maybe you might enjoy here. Place has few flowers/plants to get amazed to. Parking is also difficult.|Francis_Elvis_Verdin|What a perfect place for an Instagramable, no need to use a filter because the place will give a perfect combination of shots.|Lala L|It is very amazing place. The view is very amazing. It is very relaxing. It is a perfect place to take amazing photos|IndayDVlogger|A place to be amazed with the flowers blooms so perfectly.My favorite flower is Sunflower. It blooms so perfect and so beautiful. A sweet escape to see nature right infront of your two eyes.|Pio|my mother enjoy here a lot she is a flower lover that is why we came here. .and the children enjoy too, , ,,|BLOVE|Sirao Flower Garden is a nice place to go. With variety of flowers in sight you will enjoy the view of the beautiful garden. Entrance fee is P100. a lot of good spots to take pictures with friends.

Osmena Peak,Nature & Parks, ₱30.00 ,"Mantalongon, Dalaguete 6022 Philippines",201,4.5,"jason t|Osmeña Peak was a great place and have such amazing view I have Cool ride to this location, calming scene on the road as well. Fun and quick hiking. Additionally, the vista from the top is stunning. It is best to visit there right at sunrise or sunset to get the best images to remember the experience.|Danielle|At 1013 metres above sea level, it stands as the highest point on the island of Cebu. Osmeña Peak is a great beginners level hike. In around 15 minutes you would already have reached the top of the peak. Despite being the highest peak, it’s not that steep at all and is an easy, beautiful hike. The area has been nicknamed ‘Little Baguio’ for its cooler climate and abundant cabbage and lettuce farms. Despite climbing and arriving in gloomy weather, the fog cleared up just minutes before we were about to leave. Exposing the peculiar picturesque landscape of the pointy chocolate hills which we used to our advantage and took thousands of photos immediately. Try and time it so you’re there at sunrise or sunset and avoid wet weather. Kuya Joy, our guide, was such a good sport with taking all our instagrammable pictures and videos. He was like a human drone with all the instructions on how to pose and the video transitions. He also shared to us about how he learned about the peak and being a guide in only 9 years old. He trekked with professional mountaineers by then so they themselves gave him tips and tricks to climbing mountains which he was able to use as he became an official guide of the peak. Message me for his contact details if you’re looking for a trustworthy and helping guide. Not only that, we were accompanied by Billy. The cutest and sweetest dog, who the locals say was a tour guide in his past life. He climbed with us all the way up and down the peak, and simply rested while we were busy taking pictures. We were told that there used to be a group of girls who climbed and put up tents at the peak years ago, but because of the wind and rain their tent broke down, and because they did not have a guide that time, they were worried they wouldn’t be able to go down safely. Luckily, Billy was there. He was right outside their tent. They spoke to him as if he were human and he understood. Billy was able to lead the girls back to safety and that was just one of the many amazing stories about him.As you can see, visiting this place is more than just the beautiful peak itself. It’s the people, the community, the sweat and tears you may break, the reminder of how fragile our lives really are, how big the world is, and the experience.🏷️ ₱50 per person, ₱100 for the required and hired guide. Guides are mandatory.|Chi_Tiff|I will say this, if you’re going to go to Osmeña Peak, go just before sunset and bring a small picnic or food with you so that you can stay and enjoy the sunset views. It’s a far drive and the way up is quite bumpy. The hike itself it only about 15-20 minutes and the guide I had was lovely!!  I’d definitely visit again, but this time I’d be prepared and make sure it was worth the long drive!!!|Athena Gonzales|I visited this place during the weekend to unwind. It only took me around 20 minutes to reach the peak, yet the fascinating view, along with the cool mountain breeze, paid off and made the hike way more rewarding than I expected. I had a great time relaxing given that the place wasn't that crowded. Ultimately, the best thing about the place was the locals. The local tour guides were astoundingly kind and hospitable.|KhanKluay|After almost an hour bike ride from Badian, where we stayed, the bum hurts a bit. After parking the bikes road side, a steepish but not at all strenuous 30 min hike, climbing to the top, the views all over the island are more than rewarding. Many young and even older Filipino folks were climbing and hiking the peak, too, which is THE landmark of southern Cebu Island. It was an amazing experience, which I would do again and again, next time in Cebu. It is also a great activity for those who are based in Moalboal.|Taylor S|Went here a year but the flashbacks of coming here again is enticing indeed. Chill ride coming here. Relaxing view along the way, too. Short and fun hiking. And the view on the top is simply breathtaking. Best to go there just in time for the Sunrise or Sunset to capture the perfect photos to treasure the experience.|Jakub H|Way to Osmena for example from Moalboal (about 2 hours with motorbike). The hike is very short. I hiked up by 15 minutes, but i walked quite fast. If there is goof visibility you will have stunning view. If you want to climb it you have to pay fee, but this fee is ridiculous.|R0dent|Sadly, on the day I visited, there was light rain and fog which obstructed the view.  But even with obstruction, there is breathtaking mountainous scenery that isn't usual for the Philippines.  The fog made it look like we were hiking up the Himalayas in a scene right out of National Geographic.To get to the trail head from Cebu City, you should take one of many buses from Cebu's South Bus Terminal to Dalaguete.  When alighting after a three hour ride, you can ask a motorcycle driver to take you to the trail head.  We were charged P200 per head for the 30 minute round trip bike ride.At the trail head, you will be solicited to rent a walking stick for P10.  You should definitely take it.  The hike up and down can be slippery and difficult as the trail is unpaved and poorly defined.  You'll be frequently navigating rocks at steep angles.  There is a high chance of falling without a walking stick if it's foggy or raining.At the trail head, it doesn't look like you can walk all the way to the peak.  But you can with the trail veering left behind some hills all the way up.  You'll just keep going until you reach the top which took us around 30 minutes.  Guides will be available for hire at the trail head for P150 who might be useful when taking photos.The view at sunset might be breathtaking, but the walk down can be treacherous after the sun sets.  In the valleys, it gets really dark really quick.  We had to use the flashlights in our phones.  Had the phones ran out of battery, it'd be near impossible to trek down.  Notice the area is sparsely developed which means no medical care if you need it.|Faithalicious_x|We arrived for sunset on a cloudy day and even though we couldn't see to far the views of the surrounding mountains and the sunset that we could see was rather nice. The hike itself is pretty easy and straightforwards, it takes about 15-20 mins and could be done in flip flops if you really wanted to...we opted for trainers. Entry was 30 pesos, avoid getting a guide - they really aren't necessary at all. We mistakenly thought they were included as part of the ticket only to find at the end of the hike that he was expecting at least 150 pesos.The only drawback to visiting Osmena is how long the journey is from Moalboal. 90 minutes clinging on the back of a motorbike, over bumpy terrain, up and down hills, and around multiple bends was quite a lot to deal with (at least if you haven't been on a motorbike much). So it would be a personal decision as to whether climbing this peak is worth it, given the 3 hour motorbike travel time. In hindsight, I'm not sure that it is.|Anne.Shirako|there are 2 ways to get there--hike UP for 3-5 hours through beautiful terrain and mountain farms and villages OR bus to within 1/2 hour of the peak and waltz to the top in flipflops. I recommend the hike--it's tough, but you can do it!|Ladey|Hardly a hike more of the lookout spot but beautiful view. It was maybe 15-20 min from the road which was paved the whole way. Sometimes the road if washed out so it can be a bumpy ride, especially for a motorbike. It is about an hour and a half from Moalboal. Google maps gets you there when you search osmena peak trailhead.|Miss Marie|This is a really good location for watching sunset with your romantic partner. I got engaged here and became so memorable place to us. It was a long motorbike ride tho from our Moalboal (where we stayed at), I guess 2 hrs of motorbike ride. Got there at around 5pm, waited for the sunset. Didn’t expect it to be cold 😅 So I was shivering, bring your jackets then. It is safe going up, just be careful about where you’re stepping on. There’s a building and staff at the foot/entrance of the peak.|mamaroche|you can get to Osmena peak from Cebu City by riding buses bound to OSlob.  Tell the conductor to drop you off at Dalaguete juction.  There are 7-11 and Julie's bakeshop facing each other.  From there, there are habal habal with 200pesos fare roundtrip.  At around 25-minutes drive, you will arrive at the tourist's center and needs to pay 30pesos registration fee and a required guide fee of 300pesos.  Dont feel wasted with the 150pesos guide fee, let the community earn a living.  These guides will provide you better photos that you will keep forever.|Ashley Toh|My friends and I began our hike up at 1+pm, after spending the morning at Kawasan Falls. We decided to get a guide to take us up, though we later realised that the guide was not entirely necessary -- there was a clear trail leading up, and for the most part the guide was ahead of us, just waiting for us to take photos and rest along the way. Don't expect the guide to share much information about the place; our guide mainly pointed out photo spots. The climb was moderately difficult, and challenging in having to figure out your footing on the way up and down. My friends (all of us in our 20s) were able to complete the hike in slippers. The sights at the top were definitely worth the trip, and our photos turned out wonderful since the sun was directly overhead :)|itd-be-rude-not-to|I took the bus from Oslob to Dalaguete and then a bike to Osmena Peak, its a 10-15 minute easy hike up and its worth the effort for the gorgeous views. Sunrise is the best time to visit.|Jon N|We visited Osmena Peak last month while we were in Moalboal. We rented a motorcycle and ride from Moalboal, and took us almost 2 hours to reach here. The entrance fee is PHP30 each and from the entrance to the top of Osmena Peak took us less than 15 mins leisure walk. The view up at the peak is awesome, especially on a clear day.|pmtravel_10|Started the trip from Delegate - got habil habil (motorbike taxi - they hang out near the 7-11). Over 1/2 hr climb on the bike to get there. Osmena peak registration 60p. Got to top about 4.50 stayed their till 5.10 then habil habil (who waited) back to hotel paid him 500p.Osmena peak well worth the trip rough path up and lucky not to be cloudy so had pretty good sunset.|Patrick|It’s my second time to trek Osmeña Peak, and on my second visit, I had my first camping in the peak. When we reached our campsite, you’ll instantly see the various 360-degree scenic view. You’ll see the line where the sky and sea meets, the islands of Bohol and Negros, the cluster of hills, the different vegetation, all these and you’ll also enjoy the fresh breeze of air. I suggest that you visit the peak before sundown and experience the breathtaking sight of the sunset from the highest peak in Cebu. loving the place.|WeiKeatSG|Went there in the morning before the noon sun is up. It is about a 15-20mins climb to the top. Great view! You have to pay a token entrance fee and it was mostly locals while i was there. Great place to relax and soak in nature|mikee|this is the first time i went to this place and it is very beautiful. staying overnight is nice too❤️❤️. ill be back here soon."
Lapu Lapu Statue,Sights & Landmarks, Free ,"Barangay Mactan, Lapu Lapu Philippines",980,4.0,"Sydney G|A performance was planned for Gabii sa Kabilin 2023, and practically every museum had some sort of performance for the event. However, I thought the role-playing performance in the Shrine was the greatest of the bunch. There were also a number of food stalls, which led us to conclude (after testing) that this area offered the best food. Furthermore, the breathtaking sight of the historical landmark late at night with the lights illuminated was unlike any other.|Roald B|The costumes were very nice and the participants at the entrance were smiley and welcoming. There are certain parts that are filled with lights and the place is very windy.They reenact the story of Magellan and Lapu Lapu as well.|Unoh Borbajo|The shrine is a well-maintained complex that consists of several elements. The centerpiece is the larger-than-life statue of Lapu-Lapu, symbolizing his heroism and bravery during the battle. The statue stands tall and is an iconic representation of Filipino nationalism and resistance.The museum provides valuable insights into the events that unfolded and the cultural significance of Lapu-Lapu in Philippine history.  The surrounding area offers a pleasant environment with well-manicured gardens, walkways, and benches, providing a serene setting for visitors to relax and reflect on the historical significance of the site.|Ethan Cortrip|The site is a tourist place, designed and manufactured for tourists or visitors. Too many people and noise in the evening, because of the rave parties with too powerful sound system.|Keith F|An important historical site for Filipinos but a couple of monuments and a statue is all that is here.|Reslimpan|It was great to see how proud all Filipinos visiting the Lapu Lapu statues were. This 16th century Manny Pacquiao slayed Magellan on this very spot.|oldhometown99|For world history buffs, it's a must visit spot.  The man who led the first sailing expedition around the world met his end at this spot in 1521 at the hands of Lapu Lapu and his men.  A memorial to Magellan and the statue of Lapu Lapu are the highlights in a wide plaza.  Area is safe (although parking spots are not plentiful).  A bazaar of local goods are also featured on the grounds.For those who don't have any appreciation for history...it will be a bore.  For others, it will be fascinating.  Know which type of person you and your traveling companions are.|Barry J Parks@gmail.com|It’s quite impressive and the history of the area is fascinating and well explained. Being able to see the actual beach where Magellan was defeated is very important. Try to visit at night when the tide moves out.|Marco R|Of all the places we were, this was one of the ones that touched us the most, for the sake of being Portuguese and having been the place where Ferdinand Magellan was killed. Unlike everything that surrounds this place, here everything is spacious and minimally organized and careful.Tributes are paid to Lapu Lapu (named as the first Philippine national hero), the Ferdinand Magellan, commander of the first fleet that circumnavigated the world and all the historical achievements accomplished by the Spaniards in this stoppage.|Atral R|Its literally a big copper statue of Lapu Lapu.There is also a mural nearby showing the  europeans being defeated by his warriors.Only point of interest is the 2 sides of the commemorative plaque, written at different times, they reflect different ideologies, but its not worth going there for these and the row of badly placed tourist trap shops|Genesis Vargas|I loved history class, and coming to this place was an amazing feeling. Datu Lapulapu is our first Filipino Hero. We are very proud on how he depend our land in his time.|Cutie|Nice to revisit the past to appreciate the present. :-)  Historically speaking, Christianity was gained because of this strong man who fought for freedom against intruders in this land.|Ferdinand del Toro|The statue is cool to see, but it's just a statue. It doesn't do or say anything. Can't get anything from it, like all other statues. The story behind the statue is interesting. The area the statue is located in is awesome.

In the photo he's surrounded by foliage looking proud. Now he's standing in what looks like a car park. What a shame. This is amazing history on Mactan Island. Maybe he'll be moved again. There's nothing written there about the battle or how brave he must have been. Sad let down what a shame. Dianne.|Bob1O|Lots of souvenir vendors. Not much there but is of historical significance. Not many people were there the day we were there. 1/2 hour was more than enough although we were offered an opportunity to rent a boat.

Y|I'm proud to be a YAP because of my father, and my Chinese Ancestor. I may not the only 1, but many.|Simon C|Apparently, this is the oldest Chinese house in Cebu and I was told “most is original”.  I am sceptical, the floorboards like more like 35 years old not 350 and nails were not around in the 1670s.  The owners, I mam told,  stay at weekends, but hard to see quite where since their bedroom looked very unoccupied. One uncomfortable moment was in the garden where there is a harpist, who for a few peso, will play a little, at which three young children- aged between 4-7, dressed in traditional dress wake up (or are woken) from dozing in a nearby room and rush to perform a series of whirls and swirls.  They don’t look happy and I felt this bordered on child abuse.  The harpist told me these were his children, so does this make it ok?|alwaystravelsf|Wasn’t expecting much but I have to admit it was fascinating to see such an old house and being able to walk around and they even allow you to sit on furniture and touch some artifacts.  Just be respectful as it’s old.  The upstairs was cool and the bedroom is there where apparently the owners stay on weekends.  An old man was playing an old Harp and beautiful song, Fools Rush In by Elvis.|Escapementality|According to the Guide to the Philippines website, this house is not only one of the oldest in the Philippines and home to the family who helped found Cebu's Sinulog festival, but perhaps the first Chinese house built outside of China.Why such a low score for such a historic place. then?Because as a historical experience, which the Yap San Diego Ancestral House is billed as, it fails to educate the visitor at all. We visited hoping to learn something about the multicultural history of Cebu, but what little we did learn came from looking things up online after the fact.I couldn't help but compare this house to another old house that we visited nearby later in the day, the Casa Gorordo museum. While the Yap San Diego house is much older, Casa Gorordo does a far better job of communicating its history to visitors, with interactive screens, and tablet-based audiovisual tours included in the ticket price.Judging by past reviews, it appears that there used to be costumed tour guides to help people understand the property, but we saw no-one and no mention of any such service. It's incredible to me that both Yap San Diego and Gorordo charge the same 100 peso entry fee when YSD is so much smaller, less preserved, and provides no services to guests, at least when we visited.While I understand that the Yap San Diego house may not have the same funding as Casa Gorordo, surely a photocopied info sheet could be included with the admission. Or at a minimum. signs to help visitors understand the significance of the items in the house. That being said, I question the significance of many of the items. Every room is full of things, many arranged in strange ways (like a ceramic baby Jesus and a stack of abacuses sitting on an old chair). Some seem quite old, others much more modern. And there are no instructions requesting visitors refrain from touching the items or using the furniture. In fact, the majority of visitors appeared to be using the house as a backdrop for selfies, where they could sit in an antique chair by a window, or pretend to have afternoon tea with old dishes. From the people hawking souvenirs outside to the buskers inside. the house has more of a feeling of a tourist trap than a place designed with the history lover or cultural preservation in mind.In short, if you are just looking for a place to take some photos, the Yap San Diego house will probably suit your needs. If you are looking to learn about the history and culture of Cebu, you should either do a lot of research beforehand. or better yet, go to Casa Gorordo instead of you are short on time. It's a real shame, as obviously, the time periods and cultural backgrounds represented by these two houses are quite different, but unless the Yap San Diego Ancestral House takes some steps to educate visitors, I can't really recommend it as a place to learn more about Cebu, at least on its own. If you have ample time, it's a decent add-on to Casa Gorordo, since it's so close by. I'd recommend asking if there are guides available. All the staff there did was take our money, no information was provided.|loo c|The Yap-Sandiego Ancestral House is a must-visit heritage site in Cebu City. It offers a glimpse into the traditional Chinese-Filipino lifestyle during the Spanish colonial period. The house is well-preserved and showcases traditional architecture, antique furniture, pottery, and artwork. The porcelain and ceramic plates on the walls are a highlight. Guided tours are available to visitors, and the house's rich history and cultural significance make it a worthwhile stop for history and architecture buffs alike. The location in the Parian district adds to the charm of the attraction.|Czar Emmanuel|This ancestral house dating back to the 17th century is one of the main tourist attractions in Cebu City. It is located in the old Parian district of the city and is a silent witness to many historical events of the Filipino people. Inside you'll find lots of antiques. The house has two floors. The second floor is particularly interesting because of its old rooms (bedrooms, dining room, sala, etc.). Visiting this place is like travelling back in time. It is best to have a tour guide to explain to you the house's history, architecture, and the way people lived during that time.|Oscardog16|The ground floor reeked of urine. They had 2 toilets for public use but they stunk and it wafted all though the house. Upstairs was just a collection of crockery  and furniture. The displays exhibited no historical significance. Much lace to do about nothing.  If you bother to go in that is what you will see, lace adorning the tables, the window frames and the door arches. This is once you dodge the street hawkers that will not accept no for an answer. Not a place that is worth a stop.|Paz S|I visited this place in 2018 with my significant other and my daughter. The vibe was okay until we stepped into one of the bedroom. I think the house was haunted. It felt like we were not welcome in that room. I couldn’t breathe and felt uneasy, so we left.|Reslimpan|An old house with owners suffering from being hoarders, well perhaps an exaggeration but there is no rhyme or reason for the interior decoration, it has just been pieced together randomly.|Traveling Ammonite|Every single website on this place says the entrance fee is 50 Php per person, but they charged 100 per person in our group. They insisted ""iT wAs ChAnGeD iN SePtEmBeR lolol"" but failed to produce any source - even on their own website, that they themselves directed us to -  that mentioned this price change. Then they said ""Oh bUt iT wAs aNNouNcEd oN FaCeBoOk"" which, after checking out their Facebook, also wasn't true, and again they failed to produce proof that the price was raised to 100 per person.Foreigners beware, these guys are shady as hell and don't even know how to scam properly|Glenn W|The house structure is amazing enough but to add to that the house is jam packed with various collectables no doubt gathered by the family over a considerable period of time. The house is still used by the family, apparently. I think it is worth the admission price.|richj65|Esthetically pleasing interior but cramped  and overprised. The rudeness of the staff also does not help. Take a look from the outside but keep going to another site.|Agot76|This trip was actually a back-up plan because the neighboring museum was closed for renovation. We were so glad we did this. Not only the tour guide was knowledgeable enough but he was also a good choreographer/photographer for our group. He took the time to explain the history of the place and not only that, he shared his talent for photography! The pictures were wonderful! Highly recommend it.|Colleen F|I really enjoyed a stroll around this house looking at all of the antiques. The staff is friendly and the furniture was lovely. It really does take you back in time. It is only 50 Pesos, so great value for money too. To note, I've seen some reviews from people complaining about the hot and stuffy interior and people should accept that this is the Philippines and there is no aircon inside the venue, so it is very hot and humid inside, as is to be expected.|neil5050|A fantastic experience with private tour guide. He knew everything about the house and was also a great photographer taking snaps of us posing in old day poses.I’m sorry I forgot his name but he is worth it and make sure you repay his great tour at the end.A must do in Cebu!!|TengCorrea|One of the oldest houses in the Philippines at 300 years, this ancenstral home stays strong as it is has been lived in and taken care of through 10 generations. Its original structure of wood, coral stones held together by egg yolks and red clay roof is retained at more than 90%.Aside from this structure and antique items on display, what's more lovely in this place is its story which the caretaker would be glad to share to you as you walk around. I like best its generosity that you can almost feel how its owners lived as you visit its various areas (including a functional bedroom). There are photos everywhere which give the feeling that you know them.On the practical end, with an entrance fee of Php50, you can roam freely at your pace, take snaps, even sit on chairs. Just make sure to not break any stuff.It is situated in the city near other sites like Casa Gorordo, heritage monument, Magellan's Cross and Basilica.|Francis_Elvis_Verdin|The historic residence was constructed in the 17th-century featuring hand-carved furniture, art & a garden.|Citra Jatmiko|The house was very “eye catching” so that you can easily spotted its building from the main street as you have to park your vehicle in another side of the street, since the main street was a bit narrow. There were so many Philippines’ flags and decorations over the house. There were also many signs and information boards in front of the House. There's a tour guide who'll tell the stories about the house comprehensively and very detailed. The house has two floors, while on first floor was all the main rooms, like family room, dining room, kitchen, and storage for all the stuffs. On the second floor, you will just find the bedrooms, main bedroom and other functional rooms. There's a beautiful mini garden outside the house, located at the backside of the house. Worth to visit, so far... especially for those ancient geeks and historical things' nerds.|Carlos Salinas|If you want to understand the history of this house, make sure to bring a tourist guide or make your own research. Very interesting place full with antique furniture.|Michael H|Think Haw Par Villa rather than National Trust . Costumed room guides and overly packed spaces gave a less than convincing experience of colonial Cebu life. Might keep youngsters more engaged but rather oversold as a city highlite"

You’ll ve entertained by divers feeding the sea creatures.|Mississippi Analytics|While there might be some other parks out there that are a tad more impressive, that doesn't mean you shouldn't give Cebu Ocean Park a shot.

It is a unique experience that allows you and your loved ones to dine in an underwater aquarium, surrounded by marine animals next to the park's largest tank, home to sharks, rays and other exotic fish, thus offering an immersive dining experience. The 7 course meal at AQUA dining is top notch. It features a variety of seafood dishes and land-based options. They were fresh and delicious, made with locally sourced ingredients.For the best seat in the house, I recommend you to book your reservation in advance.|Guineivher Kaye C|5/5 My favorite part during our COP experience was having our lunch at the COP restaurant with a beautiful view and witnessed those divers who feed the different sea animals.|Jasper John V|One of the best experience during my stay in Cebu.

We experienced their diverse underwater restaurant world inside it. It exceeds my expectations.|Florida_family_kids|It was a lot better than I expected. Very clean and maintain.

Also, the chattering lorries stole the day.  Highly enjoyable.|Justine Mae R|We went there to freedive on their tank. The whole activity was fun. The watwr is clear and the tank is neat. The marine animals are also well fed. We actually left our freediving belt and we were able to get it even around 10pm. The guards, staff, and the manager were nice to accomodate our concern even beyond their closing hours. We'll definitely go back to dive and to visit the whole park again!|Alleonah Patric... C|I usually see most of the sea animals here in my workplace but to come here is absolutely stunning! We tried feeding the lories and we had fun! We also tried the fish spa, it was ticklish but with great experience!|Craig O|Had a nice time there. A lot of things to see. Admission was a little high in my opinion. The bird show was cute. Got to see the fishes getting fed. One bad point I had was when I went and bought an ice tea. Container was filled with unfiltered ice. Ice was not the one with the hole in the middle. Anyone traveling to here knows what I am talking about.  Needless to say, I developed the runs for a few days. My bad. I knew better.|Czar Emmanuel|If you're fond of sealife and the ocean, then this is one place you should never miss when you visit Cebu City. It has a good collection of sea creatures -- fish, sharks, stingrays, etc. -- plus other animals (like birds, snakes, and other reptiles). It also has a nice restaurant, a  footspa, a souvenir shop, and so forth. Once you enter, check out the schedule of some animal shows to make the most of your visit. Also be ready to take lots of instagrammable photos! :D|Reishe Mae Camay|Hi this is VDC Reishe, I love ocean park Cebu City.My experience with my fam which the VDC was fun and enjoyable because of the beautiful views.

It is accessible to the public because it is located near the street.|Glide Deniere|My groupmates and I had a wonderful experience in the museum. It was great being able to visit such a place.|Judd Sydney G|The museum's numerous displays and diverse collection of artworks and artifacts fascinated us. One of the most memorable pieces of art we discovered was of men holding chickens in order to start a cockfight. Nonetheless, during Gabii sa Kabilin, Museo Sugbo was unquestionably one of the night's highlights, especially with their well-prepared performances.|Yann|Museo Sugbo is a captivating museum that provides a comprehensive overview of Cebu's history and culture. The exhibits are thoughtfully curated and showcase a wide range of artifacts and displays. The museum's layout and organization make it easy to navigate and understand the historical narrative. Out of the three attractions of Cebu that we have visited during the Gabii sa Kabilin, this was by far my most favorite!|Kate|Museo Sugbo offered an indeed captivating journey through the history and rich heritage of Cebu. Overall, it was an educational and memorable experience to be in Museo Sugbo.|Kaye F|Upon entering the museum, I was immediately struck by the well-curated exhibits and the attention to detail in recreating the wartime era. One aspect that truly stood out was the multimedia presentations and interactive exhibits.  It was a thoughtful and engaging approach that made the exhibits even more immersive.|Waldo Manalang|The museum offered a fascinating journey through the rich history and heritage of the region, with well-curated exhibits showcasing artifacts, photographs, and interactive displays.

There are numerous artifacts and concise historical accounts. The timeline and information are quite well organized. Being there and getting a glimpse of Cebu's past feels really pleasant.|Rivkah Marie S|My favorite part was the secret thing inside the box and I was amazed by the arts inside it. I was a 10 for me.|Kurt E|One of the better museums that we have visited. Lots of artifacts and clear historical narratives. Great organization of  the timeline and facts. Feels very good to be there and have a glance on what the past Cebu looks like. A must visit for history enthusiasts. I wish they had more space for more artifacts though. Overall, it was a great learning experience.|Marty|Museo Sugbo ... is the Cebu Provincial Museum , located in the former Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center ( Prison ) This Cebu City Historical Museum , is found over a kilometre up the same road , from Plaza IndependenciaThe historical prison , now museum was built from coral stone ... some of this stone is from a demolished church , in the late 1870A few of this museums collection are :-• The Pre-Colonial Gallery• The Spanish Colonial Gallery• The Katipunan Revolution and the American Colonial Gallery• The War Memorial Gallery• The Museum of Philippine Political History The Prison housed not only criminals in its 135 year history - from 1870 to 2004. * During the revolution many of the Katipuneros ( revolutionist against Spanish Rule ) were incarcerated here without trial & many of them were eventually executed in nearby Carreta cemetery* During the Japanese occupation WW2 , guerrillas were imprisoned here , after enduring torture under the hands of the Kempeitai ( the Japanese secret police ) * After the war , many of the collaborators in Cebu were also imprisoned here|LolaGo1|On a Monday, I had a difficult time looking for transport from Fort San Pedro to this place.On my second attempt, I found it to be open and got excited when I learned that entrance fee is FREE!One room shows items related to various presidents of the. Philippines. Another one shows the history of Philippine Independence while another room shows relics of the past.Recommended to visit this FREE Museum!|Bea P|Cute free museum with multiple different exhibits ranging between the history of Cebuano press, the Japanese occupation, and city planning. Not necessarily a must-see, but definitely a nice respite from the searing heat if walking from Fort San Pedro to Casa Gorordo.|Lawland L|Great story about Cebu.  I started my trip with the visit and it gave me inspiration and a history that is meaningful and deep.  So much richness and details from prehistoric times and to present|Bob Ouano|Unlike Casa Gorordo which is privately run, this museum is government run (Province I think) and you can definitely tell the difference. Our tour guide was a student (Tourism I think{?} I forgot now), she had some knowledge of her subject matters and her grammar was quite faulty but made up for all of it with her attitude, smile, and very pleasant disposition. There were two sections of some five presentations, that had airconditioning and the rest you sweat like everybody else. The place is very accessible, and can be, maybe, enjoyable.|Kleinberg Fletc... T|Enrich your mind with knowledge about the past while having fun at the same time here in Museo Sugbo. Here you can learn lots of insights about how our forebears lived before, during, and after the Spanish Era. Read some letters written by Legazpi himself to the King of Spain (that's if you can understand Castilian, hehe), see an actual bomb used by the Americans during World War 2 (its really huge), and a lot more!There are just lots of things you can grasp here in Museo Sugbo. The museum has several galleries that features the entire era of Cebuano history, from the Precolonial up to the Japanese Occupation. There are also new galleries that were later added which are also very interesting to visit. The “Rice Gods and Saints” is a gallery that features a collection of anitos and pots in Ifugao. There is also a gallery for the National Historical Commission that elaborates the evolution of the “bayan” a local political entity during the precolonial era to the modern cities we have today.Each galleries are air-conditioned, with a free guided tour for your convenience. The entrance fee is only P75.00 but locals do get a much cheaper discounted price. A souvenir shop and a cafe is also available though it isn't open all the time.|Vic Raymund|This is used to be a Prison Cell & converted into a Museum. They also accepts for Functions & Party.|Andrew Scott G|Take the tour, the guides are great at showing you around and explaining things.  Lots of great artifacts and displays.|Felixberto E|The tour guide was very helpful with the historical display and artifacts, we got to learn more about own ethnic origins! Very interesting displays, very good museum guides.|Edwin R|This museum is not that big, but it packs a lot of history.  My favorite was during The World War II.  I didn't know that the Filipinos had briefly used Japanese currency.  Their new ""Rice of Gods"" room was amazing.  Our tour guide mentioned a private donor from a Filipino philanthropist, donated everything in the room to share the history of Cebu.  We were also educated that Museo Gugbo was originally a prison.  There were still marks of prisoners name and other carvings during that era.  One highlight that was also a favorite of mine was the walk of fame wall where all the past Presidents of the Philippines were hung in portrait paintings.  Next to their portraits shares a brief history of their life and accomplishments during their time in office.  I highly recommend if you have time during your visit to Cebu City, pay a visit here.  You will learn a great deal about Philippine history and the native tribes of Cebu.Cheers!"

The place was not far from Cebu City but the traffic and rough roads to get here is the reason for close to 3hr drive.The place had a lot of people, we went directly up the main church.

VILMA VITUG JENNINGS here 😍 all my love 😍|Zayn|Today, we visited this place. We ought to have a solemn prayer unfortunately the place was very crowded. And there was one guy on duty shouted on us. We know our fault but its not a major offense,  he didn't have to shout and humiliate us in front of the crowd. I knew his doing his line of work but is it right to humiliate us?|Manfred P|In Beton gegossenes Khatolisches religiöses Dineyland.Catholic religious Disneyland cast in concrete.|Taylor S|Went here for a Religious Tourism and it was divine. The place is truly solemn and reverent. Feels like that any prayer of a sincere heart will be granted by this place.

I believe , is the shorten name ( could be mistaken , as I’m not a Filipino ) I noticed a meaningful sign , up the top of the first ramp up to the Simala Shrine — You are here a PILGRIMS , NOT AS TOURISTS to offer praise, Thanksgivings, Sacrifices, & Petitions to God and Mama Mary Even thou I’m surely not Catholic ... you feel something there In any respect ... I’m elated 😀😁 to finally have been able to make my way to Simala Shrine As previously , over a year now , I’ve been looking at traveling to visit the Simala Shrine ... however disappointingly 😖 I was always quoted between P2500 - P3500 for a return trip by taxi or Hire Van As yesterday , with intending to travel by V Hire Van ( from Junquera St , Van transit depot ) to Carcar City ... to have an explore , I discovered that the V Hire - P100 , travels through to Sibonga - which is the small township nearest the Shrine ... with this I described to continued on ( give it a go 😁 glad I did ) After having a uneventful quick look around Sibonga , I traveled by Tricycle the near 5kms to Simala Shrine - P150 I later discovered ( whilst at the Shrine ) that the V Hire Van I was on actually travels just to Simala Shrine & returns to Cebu City - even through on the side of the V Hire states it travels to Santander ... therefore after my interesting look around Simala Shrine , I was conveniently able to catch another V Hire Van back to Cebu City 😁As usually whenever you catch a V Hire Van from any of the depots around Cebu City , the Van’s has it’s final destination on the side door ... as for the van depots , each depot is the transit point for V Hire Vans traveling to their different locations across Cebu ( even thou these V Hire Vans are all one company )The Simala Shrine is located nearly 2 hours south of Cebu City , on Mama Mary Sanctuary Roard , Sibonga ... as a few Facebook address post maps , have Simala Shrine in Cebu CityOpening hours at Simala Shrine :• 7 days     8am - 8pmHoly Mass Schedule :• Sunday – 12:00nn & 3:30pm• Monday to Friday – 12:00nn• Saturday – 10:30am• 13th of the month – 10:30am & 3:30pmIt is free entrance to the Simala Shrine ... with Religious donations welcomed Over many decades ... the Miraculous castle like Simala Shrine , is still being built by the Marian Monks of Eucharistic Adoration ... who serve as the guardian of this sacred site ... with the help of different communities of SistersWithin the church main building ... for the devoted , there are many “Dagkutanan” ( meaning a place for candle lighting ) For choosing your candles at the Shrine • Gold – Healing ( good health , recovery , spiritual , family tree )• Green – Prosperity / Success ( exam , study , financial , business )• Blue – Perseverance ( employment , career, assignment , promotions )• Violet – Achievement ( plans in life , struggles, endeavours , journey , voyage )• Red – Love ( unity , friendship , engagement , family )• Yellow – Peace ( courage , strength , hope )• White – Purity ( enlightenment , guidance , right path )• Orange – Reconciliation ( sweetheart , wife , husband , enemy , family )• Pink – Thanksgiving / Happiness / Joy ( spiritual , physical )• Black – Souls ( forgiveness , pardon )• Brown – Vocation ( marriage bond , God’s servant , single life )• Grey – Deliverance ( bad ways , things , spirits )• Cream – Conversion / Faith ( children , household , couples )Please note ... there is a strict dress code into Simala Church grounds :• No Sleeveless / Tube / Short Blouses• No Shorts above the knees ( men / women )• No Sleeveless men’s T-Shirts• No Mini Skirts• No Fitting or Transparent Pants• No inappropriate images or language of cloths • Plus No Smoking or Alcoholic Drinks• Plus No food or water - consumed outside|Flappy Hanson|We went to Simala Shrine during our very short weekend trip to Cebu. We rented a car at the airport and spent overnight at a resort in Mactan. The next day, with the help of Waze, we were able to reach the shrine, also known as the Monastery of the Holy Eucharist. The road leading to the shrine is called Mama Mary Sanctuary Road.As a Catholic, I consider this place as a pilgrim site rather than a tourist attraction. Since this is a religious place, proper dress code must be observed. Sleeveless clothes and shorts are not allowed.God bless us...|BennieGS2016|Just an hour or less from cebu city center. Faithfuls tambayan. Since it is a sacred Place, you ask by prayer and tru faith (geniune), your wish might be granted.|Clarizz|They have a strict compliance of proper dress codes. No short shorts and mini skirts, no sleeveless, no dresses above the knee, etc.People downstairs offer ""sarongs"" for rent. Also, arm yourself with your own umbrella, fan, and water. If you're visiting in ""hot & sunny hours"".There are umbrellas for rent downstairs too.God bless us all! 🙏|NPLim|No matter how huge the church is, you can still hear the songs and prayers from the outside which will touch your heart. I feel blessed paying visit in this Church with my family. This can be one of your  faith enrichment destinations and you will be amazed by stories that made this Church where it is now.|Brian Austin Cartin|As you stroll along the long bridge/hall towards the church, the view is mesmerizing and leaves you at awe! The devotion and dedication of the people to create a shrine or rather a palace for the Blessed Virgin Mary is indubious and should be commended. The scale of it is very large and you can see intricate details as you circle the area. Just enjoy the view and if you are willing, you can light up a candle and pray for the things you want.|marion93722|A testament of faith for the deep devout and solemn place. It’s amazingly huge. Well tucked in a local place. Be prepared to cover up but no worries for there are scarves for sale outside. Lots of mementos from miraculous healings. There is a route to kiss/pray to the virgin. A few minutes drive from Oslob for orientation on the location.|eLL|If you are religious person, you can go here (even if you're not). They so strict with dress code. No to dress or shorts above the knee (no to sando/tanks or slippers). It should be below the knee (decent) or you can bring shawl to cover. The place has great structure (still under repair). There's restroom inside the shrine which you will pay PHP 20.00 every time you go inside (lol).If you will go here for taking pictures/site seeing, 30 mins to an hour is ok since traveling from this place to main town is 1-2 hours and you need to stop over for ""PASALUBONG AREA"".|Eaten A|I’ll acknowledge that some people might see it as an over glorified concrete souvenir shop.  It is mostly concrete and it does have a souvenir shop.That said the architecture is actually really interesting both inside and out.As a holy place it attracts many people to pray, very many, so if you want to pray at specific altar you will be lining up for a bit.The toilets there were very clean; The rest of the place offers lots of photo opportunities.There are Restaurants outside.I think it’s worth a visit, it would a shame to be in Cebu and miss out such a place in the world.|iankatipunan|Simala Shrine tour was really not part of our itinerary, but since my mother can't make a 30min walk to Kawasan falls, we went here instead.As we approach the gate, we were amazed as we see its castle-like facade, with arcaded corridors, aqueduct-like bridge connecting the garden to the shrine. The structure is also PWD-friendly, with ramps placed everywhere.Inside the shrine was a chapel, a praying area where colored candles lit, and a museum where testimonies of healed and answered prayers are kept and displayed.By the way, before going inside, bear in mind that proper attire is strictly implemented. Men wearing sando or tank top with shorts and slippers, and women wearing spaghetti straps, with very short shorts and slippers are not allowed. But if you're already worn shorts, don't worry! There are vendors outside the gate that will let you rent their shawls for Php20!If you're a Marian devotee and for Catholics who are ""sagrado katoliko"" I really recommend visiting the place. It will make your faith stronger as you see the evidences of the healed and answered prayers, and the people offering candles, roses and prayers to the pictures, portraits and sculptures of the Blessed Virgin Mary."
Pescador Island,Nature & Parks, ₱25.00 ,"Tanon Strait, Moalboal Philippines",565,4.5,"uzmelissa|Nice snorkeling spot for corals especially, some people wrote it's not perfect after thypoon may be it's a really better before but at overall it took 1 hour snorkeling around there and we saw lots of corals and fish, it was enough and enjoyable spot for us and our tour brought us to sardines and turtles to Moalboal, we swam 1 hour also there. Tour spots are fare I think, I would recommend 👌|joywu1001|The guide told us that it was full of beautiful coral and sealife two years ago, but the devastating typhoon killed a lot of it a year ago. Currentlym they're still working to recreate the coral and sealife. During my snorkel, I did see quite a few fish of different colors. I think this place is worth going if you're not a great swimmer, and have worries about the sea current or big waves. The boatmen bring you to a peaceful area where there are no waves, and you can snorkel or dive easily. Snorkeling here boosted my confidence in getting into the waters more.|Kozi Tsen|The tour centers are asking 3,000 (per boat) for the island hopping! And on top of that, 100 per person for environmental tax. We were only 2 persons, so we asked if we can join other groups, they said they don't accommodate joiners anymore due to covid. I highly doubt that! I think each boatmen are waiting ""in-line"" for their turn to take tourists and now they want each boatmen to earn each day from the tourists. The more groups of tourists, the more boatmen will be needed! Can u imagine? I think it is unfair! So we didn't do the island hopping. Anyway it is only for this island Pescador.And also corals are now dead due to the typhoon but they will not tell you anything, of course! All they want is your money, not your welfare! Take note and Be careful!|Frank|Avoid going if you're snorkeling. The corals were damaged during a  recent typhoon and there's pretty much nothing left. You are wasting your money if you go. My gf and I were so disappointed. Spend your money on other tours around. Yes, they bring you to Moalboal beach for the sardine and turtles but don't waste your time for Pescador Island.|Marc G|On the positive side: Nice topography with walls dropping down to -50m, the Skull cave is very interesting.Good place for freediving for advanced divers.On the negative side: every island hoping boat anchors on the shallow plateau, all the hard corals were killed by anchors a long time ago. The site if  over-fished.. It is  be part of the Tanon Strait Marine Park, it has current and it is surrounded by deep water, it should be full of pelagic predators.. But because of constant fishing, it is empty of fish. Divers are lucky if they see a couple of snappers and a skipjack tuna. You ' ll be happy if you like frogfish and nudibranchesLet' s hope that this place will finally get the protection it deserves..|Steve|It's an awesome day trip! Take a boat from almost anywhere in Moalboal, sit back, relax and enjoy the 25 to 35 minute ride to Pescador Island. It's just a small little outcrop in the middle of the straight between Cebu and Negros. We don't usually go for the Island itself (there's nothing really on it and it is protected), but it is a favorite spot to hang out, snorkel, dive, and enjoy the beautiful coral reefs surrounding it. I spent my 49th birthday out there. We had three boats full of family and just partied!|Jakub H|We did there 2 dives. First by east side and second one by west side. This island is full  of live. I also like chinese tourists drowning on the surface.|Cynthia M|Great Dive location.  Did it twice.  A definite must do!!!  The marine life is plentiful.  If you take your time and look carefully you can see lots of small creatures.|高展斯|We went to Pescador as part of a 3 stop boat trip which included turtles, sardines, and Pescador Island.  The turtles were very cool, sardines were the real highlight, but the island was a bit underwhelming.|elinak821|we went there for a few hours on a diving boat. very nice experience, clean' beutiful location, many turtles"
Aguinid Falls,Nature & Parks, ₱300.00 ,"Barangay Tangbo, Samboan 6027 Philippines",276,4.5,"ckwong|I really would not have gone to the Falls if I had known I would have to climb up 8 levels of waterfalls by clutching the walls like spider man with the water cascading downwards with no option of stopping once the climb begins at the 1st level. I am 75 years old and my wife 68 years. There is no harness to hold you back shd you topple backwards. Only one guide to pull you up and one below you push u up. But one cannot stop because climbing downwards is impossible. you just have to keep climbing up. There are small grooves chiselled into the wall for your hand and feet to clutch or step in. I was praying like crazy for God to lift me up. Just keep climbing to get to the top and get out. Praying very hard for my wife too because she is not into sports at all. But we made it to the 8th level. I  must say it was dangerous looking back but some sort of achievement having done it .It was exhilarating but frightening. A once in a lifetime experience. Excellent xperience because we made it alive. But I wont do it again.|Bob W|Had an amazing time climbing these waterfalls with the guides.  The guides were conscientious and made sure we were safe and having fun.  The waterfalls were beautiful and the pools were so refreshing!  We surprised ourselves reaching the 8th level with their help as we are both in our late 50’s and only moderately active (but we love adventures!!).  Highly recommend this activity|Bee A|Highly recommend. Thrill seekers will love it but not just that, I’m the biggest coward yet I loved it. Please do it. It’s scary but honestly so fun.|Paula V|It's not as touristy as other waterfalls for sure but for an introverted office worker like me, the Aguinid Falls course is just right. I loved being among the quiet lush greenery. I'm always in the city so to see greenery instead of buildings and cars was very refreshing. Initially, I was a bit apprehensive because it does not look very impressive in the photos, but surprisingly I had a very good time! The course was a little bit hard for a weakling like me (I really do not get enough exercise) but not hard enough to make me want to quit halfway. The guides are very friendly and helpful. They don't demand you to tip but my friends and i gave my guides 400 pesos each.. thank you for ensuring our safety. I don't go out a lot so I was a little scared about the course. They always helped me when I needed help in carrying my weight.Thank you csp for the ride there.. we appreciate the free towels (I forgot to bring my own) and also the go pros because we don't have any of those at home. Next time, I will bring my own waterproof bag.. my phone almost got wet.|Bb Josephine|Went for a quick visit here and it was truly the highlight of our Day!  There is an Entrance Fee of Php 300 per Persons (inclusive of Entrance Fee, Environmental Fees, Guide Fees and Safety Gears (shoes and helmet) and I think it was worth the price. The falls was until 8th Level and I can say each level was a true combination of adventure and beauty. Our Guides (Kuya Mark and Ate Cora) were very friendly and supportive.|Cesar G|This is our second time to visit Aguinid falls. After swimming with the whale sharks, we went to the falls. First we had lunch at the entrance site where they cooked our meal. It was delicious! P1,200 for 4 main dishes with rice and coconut water. There were leftovers in our group of 5.Compared to last year(Jan. 2019), the entrance fee jumped from P60 to 300. There was no required guide last year and no shoes and helmet. Appreciated the shoes as the rocks can be slippery and the ground uneven. This time, there are 8 levels compared to 5 last year. Our guide Andrew is very friendly and helpful. The place itself is still beautiful. But there is less water and some areas are without water. Last year, the water current and the falls were spectacular! Was told there was drought all year? Enjoyed the rock climbing part with and w/o rope. I thought it was more fun last year. Maybe it was because it was our first time?|Gusts L|It was very beautiful. After diving and visiting cities it was a breath of fresh air. You will have to guides assigned to you. We were 4 persons, me my wife and our two children. 16 and 13 years old. We were able to climb all the levels of the waterfall. Price was 300 pesos per person. Plus after we gave100 pesos tip to the guide. Both guides help you to get up at more technical places.|Neal O|We went as a couple and had an amazing adventure here. The pair of us were new to waterfalls and the falls were just perfect for non-climbers. A real adventure. What we would have done without are two excellent guides I don’t know, Carlos and his cousin lead us with expert and got this 61 year old and partner up the 8 levels with great care.Thoroughly recommended for the adventurous first timer. A waterproof camera would be a good extra as the scenery here is breathtaking.|Annakristin147|Highly recommend- the guides are very helpful and it was an amazing experience. There are 9 levels you can pass and each is unique and refreshing. The guides take amazing pictures of you and help you to bring your bags safe and dry to the other side. So far best experience for waterfalls|Len|Completely disorganized operation, and blame can lie with the employees who work here, and I assume their government superiors.  Rude to customers, did not provide adequate information on the falls.   Way over priced for what you get.  I would not recommend as there are far better waterfalls to visit in the area."

It was under renovation when we arrived although we were still able to enjoy an excellent meal.  Definately worth the trip.|Jay Santos|Beautiful to visit during at night.

Its overlooking CEBU because the place place is top of the mountain and it has a very nice view specially in the afternoon when the sunset goes down. plus the restaurant around there where there is a lot of tourist going just to dine and see the place|A Santiago|Amazing view of the city lights at night. Place is mostly tidy but some visitors are not responsible with their trash. Nevertheless, the air is good and the view is much better when shared with good company|Irish Mae|perfect place to chill. It offers 360 degrees view of Cebu City. We went there during night, it was fogging and the city lights of cebu city is amazing to look|Sazeena N|A wide view of the city esp. at night. The night view of this place is just amazing. It is also amazing to see people gathering, do bbq along with the sunset and night view. The wind is quite strong there in an enjoyable way. The Entrance fee is 100 PHP per person and the visit is much more worth the amount.|Francis_Elvis_Verdin|A Nice view if you visit the Tops Lookout during the sunset time because you will witness the transformation of daytime to twilight and also the view of street lights.|raycoyd|Tops lookout is really a nice vantage point if you love to see Cebu City and other neighboring Cities like Mandaue and Talisay City. The best time to come here is during sunset to night where you can see the dazzling lights of the cities below. The temperature is cold.|brine|all i see is the wide vision of the city. . it is good to be here at summer time and not in bad weather. . all are visible in good weather and at night so nice|Carlos Salinas|It is the perfect spot to enjoy your last night in Cebu. Up on the top, they have food and drink stalls and make sure to bring your camera for nice pictures.|conte|nothing so special here and not so accessible without private vehicle,less options of my demands, , not so interesting in my opinion. . .|LolaGo1|We arrived here around 11:00 am on a Tuesday morning. Entrance fee is 50 pesos per person. I was the only visitor at this time. All the small restaurants around the Lookout were all closed.Due to its elevated location, the cities below can be seen from the distance. Took several pictures here before leaving  for my next attractions.|Vez A|It was almost a snap decision to spend time in Tops Lookout. We were rewarded with a fantastic view of the city, with a refreshing wind blowing constantly. Although the place needs some sprucing up, we recommend that first time visitors to Cebu take some time to visit this place. It won’t disappoint. A coffee shop would do wonders for guests who’d want to stay a little longer.|Robert W|You must get a gas taxi to go there, not propane. It's a great view, but not much to do after 15 minutes.|Ryan S|This place reminded me of Twin Peakes in San Francisco or the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. Panoramic views for 100 miles or more. I was disappointed that they charged to enter the park when it appeared to be free according to most places. I went in the day time when it was dead and do not regret it. Apparently it is mobbed at night and there is no parking available then, or at least it is insufficient.|Samcebu|Great views of the city got to go in the evenings better for pictures. There are no activities there hard to get to but worth I.|reddogsailor|Excellent Food and a wonderful place to see the sunset over Cebu. Prices are reasonable also. Highly recommend the stuffed Tuna belly.|Wenifer Dawson|When you enjoy nature at nights with a great view of the city lights being peaceful and quiet then you have to check out this place. Friends and families can hang around while having a good chat. There are also good restaurants within the area.|Peewee Rodney S|The place and the view are breathtaking except the rusted roof needs urgent replacement! It is embarrassing when capturing with a drone cam, even with our naked eyes standing on the center or edge of the location. The rot reflects negligence so act fast, please!"
Paradise Beach,Nature & Parks, ₱250.00 ,Philippines,238,4.5,"tianrey126|Arguably one of the best beaches in Bantayan Island. Also known as Sandira Beach. It is a bit secluded and there was a fee to enter. It was P60 but a signage advised it will increase to P80 starting April 01, 2023. Clear water and white sand. Perfect place to relax and be lazy. You can bring your own food and drinks but be sure to clean afterwards and dispose of your trash properly. A must visit when in Bantayan Island|Steven S|Google Maps showed 3.3kms from town so I decided to walk there for exercise passing The Ruins on the way. I followed Google Maps which directed me down a road off to the left and eventually to a local man who charged 25 pesos. I asked him what the charge is for. He said for the private beach. I told him there are no private beaches in the Philippines (unless it is at a privately owned island). Anyway, I paid the fee which was really for crossing private land. I ended up entering the water before the actual beach.Very nice beach, clean sand and clear water. There was some trash around off the beach. When I left the beach I found a parking area and a public dirt road that led me back to the main road. From the main road there is no sign pointing the way to this beach. Only a big sign with all the rules and regulations to visit the beach. This public road is about 500 metres further on from where Google Maps directs you. Of course the unscrupulous land owner is not honest enough to redirect you to the public road. I stopped two ladies on bicycles and redirected them to the public road. DO NOT follow Google Maps.|Mary jean Q|This is as the name says, a Paradise Beach. It is the best beach on Bantayan Island; very clean, white powder sand, crystal clear water, great for snorkelling and swimming, also good for cliff jumping when tide is high, very quiet early on mornings for sunrise. It’s only 20 pesos entrance but this pays to keep it clean. It’s a bit hidden away from the busy Santa Fe but that’s why I like it. We also stay at Paradise Beach Guest House which is walking distance to this beach & highly recommend that resort! It’s a new resort, budget friendly, great food, all new facilities, good WiFi, peaceful and has great hosts! Highly recommend Paradise Beach & the Guest House. 5 ⭐️|TengCorrea|Located about 30 minutes from Sta Fe town, this is a secluded beach that has clear waters and gently sloping sandbed. Nothing much to do except just swim and laze around or explore the rocks nearby. (I'm letting the photos speak for themselves.)It's best to go in the morning as umbrella shades are on a first come, first served basis. There are no restaurants so you need to bring your own food and drinks.Entrance fee at 50 pesos. I got there via a habal-habal for 200 pesos roundtrip. I'm sure you can haggle or go there using your own ride.|Axel|This place is perfect for swimming..Clear and relaxing.I must say this is the highlight of bantayan trip if you love to swim under the sun|sergeyp7777|Nothing special. I've seen better. Actually beaches in Santa Fe are better.It is far from Santa Fe, and they charge fee to enter this beach.|Srdan|A really amazing beach with crystal clear water and white sand. It wasn't crowded and we enjoyed it while our visit in February 2020. It is about 20 minutes tricycle ride from Santa Fe and for a return ride it will cost you around 300 PHP.|Francesc R|Very nice small beach in the southwest of Bantayan Island.Good for chilling and sunbathing.Entrance fee (50 PHP/person).There aren’t amenitis, but you can buy something 200 meters before the entrance.|Paul C|We always enjoy having a picnic here during Amihan season when the beach is clear of seaweeds and the water so clean and clear. Few tourists|Harry O|Gorgeous serene beach.  A must see. No services so bring your own food and drinks.  No lounge chairs so bring a towel. Very safe for swimming.  Expect to pay 50 pesos entrance fee which is nothing really.  Taxi or motorbike will take you there and wait for you until you're ready to come back|Peter R|The white beach lies under black rocks and with its greenery and trees offers beautiful views. The water counts with lot's of seagrass and looks a bit greenish; still it is deep and nice to swim there and also snorcheling is possible.  To stay longer at the beach you need some protection as the sun hits down without mercy. The roads to the beach are in bad condition and you might need 45 minutes from Santa Fe to reach there. The visit of the beach costs entrance and there is no possibility to buy drinks or food. In my opinion the beach is still worth a visit but you should go well prepared.|Mel Brockhouse|White sands, clear blue sea, not many people aboutIf you are looking for a slice of paradise then this is for you|Paul V|Given that there are not a huge number of things to do on nonetheless lovely Bantayan Island, it is worth a visit to Paradise Beach.  It is a lovely spot althoigh narrow at high tide.  There is nothing at all there except the beach.  We took a tuk tuk and bargained to 200 pesos to take us there for about an hour or so and then return to Santa Fe.|thedzki|Entrance fee of 50Php and opens as per the signage outside 9-5PM. But I guess you can come as early as that (so I’ve heard). The place needs maintenance, and there’s not enough cottages to accommodate the crowd, so better bring your own shelter to keep you from being deep-fried under the sun! Although this beach is good for swimming and has a white sand (the only thing it differs from the other beaches), there’s nothing more to see from here. Just enjoy your stay far from the City.|Gorgeous S|I’ve read in the internet that they open at 9am to 5pm. Had we known we should have gone there earlier while it was still not that hot. But one tricycle driver told us that they open as early as 6am. And so we went 8:30am but upon seeing the seaweeds washed off the shore, God the maintenance person there was raking them back to shore. God what a dumb! Guests are starting to come and how could they enjoy swimming if there are lots of seaweeds floating? Bakit di nlng idustpan at itapon sa mga bato sa taas diba? What a mindset. I dont know if utos ng may-ari or sadyang tinatamad lng kaya tapon nlng pabalik sa dagat? May entrance fee pa na P50. Jusko not worth it. Ayusin nyo muna cleanliness nyo bago kayo magpapasok turista. Nakakahiya.|wellred99|Lovely clear water which makes for great swimming. Some leaves had blown in the day we went but it didn't stop us getting in the water.Note this beach is not free to enter. You need to 1st pay a fee up top and then again on the beach. I don't understand why there are 2 fees for this. Don't forget to stop at the cliff drop steps for 'that picture'.|EarthyGirl24|Visited here in the morning and in the afternoon. Everything is still nature. The staff in the entrance and the Guard assigned are friendly.I love the Beach a lot that when we went to the other resort we kinda compare it to the Paradise Beach/Sandira Beach and Went back after our Meals. And witnessed the lovely sunset.During low tide the beach isn't that pretty anymore but you can still enjoy the sandy beach and have a chitchat with your love ones. My 2 yr old son love it and played sand castle till sunset.I found out that Sandira Beach , Sta fe beach resort and Ogtong cave resort has the same owner.Hope it won't get commercialized as the days goes by...So while everything there is still on its nature. Visit now!|MelbourneTravelmad|This is a busy beach with several resort type places on or near the beach. The water was not the clearest, and perhaps the cleanest, around. There is limited shelter from the sun unless you're at one of the resorts. Sand was clean and typically coral based with small chunks of coral among the sand. An ok beach, but there are better.|Mjleon89|Nice clean and clear waters but there wasn’t a lot of amenities only a few nipa umbrella sheds. Good for a tan and swim for an hour or so.|Trancazia|Paradise Beach or also known as Sandira Beach is pure unspoiled beauty off the beaten track a little but don't worry as most good Trike drivers will get you there, the entrance fee is about 50 PHP a short walk then your jaw will drop, definitely the place to chill, unwind, do some rock jumping or even swim this is the place.Would I return? Yes for sure and may even camp over.Who would enjoy this location?  All ages, if you have difficulties in walking there is a small drop down to the white sand, but nothing too drastic."

It’s a beautiful place for an afternoon walk. Even though it was hot while we were there , there is plenty of shade to be foundWe had a volunteer tour guide for part of our visit this time. He was filled with information, but delivery was pretty boring and he spent way to long in each section, so after a while I tipped him 300 pesos and we explored on our own. Where the tour guide is really helpful is in the galleries to explain the art pieces, after that I suggest type and go on your own.|Rojo Tapiador|The tour was nice. Entrance Fee: 30 Pesos (Price same for locals and foreigners)It's not as big as intramuros but the ambiance of the colonial era can still be felt. Some locals we're doing photo shoots for debuts. Lots of tourists but the line was not long because a single person can buy the ticket for the group. Overall, happy but not sure if coming back again.|PJB|Visited today30 peso entrance feeWell kept compared to fort Santiago  but smaller however still very impressiveHad a wonderful time soaking it all up|RanjitM|The fort itself is quite compact. a nice walk around which would not be for more than half hour. Ask for the guide, who're usually tourism students that are interning. They shall provide a nice historical background to each element of the Fort, as well a history into the Spanish entry into Cebu.They even have a cannon from one of Magellan's original ship ( i think / or from the first war in the 15th Century)|Simon C|I enjoyed my visit around this ancient fort which is very solidly constructed – some of the walls are well over a metre thick and you can easily visualise how effective a stronghold this was.  There is a tiny entrance fee (20 peso).  A little more information about its heritage and day to day operations would have been very informative.|alwaystravelsf|Pretty cool to see but not that exciting for me.  History buffs might appreciate it more but I didn’t get that excited and it was Hot AF.  Small entrance fee comes with tour guide but I was kinda in a hurry so possibly why I didn’t enjoy it so much.|Ishi Lavador|It was nice to get a glimpse of Cebu's colonial past. The architecture was well-preserved and they even have the canons there. It's surreal that its the oldest fort in the Philippines and it's still around til today. Definitely worth the visit and would definitely go again! :)|Francis Demetri A|Fort San Pedro in Cebu City offers a captivating glimpse into the city's colonial past.

While relatively small in size, it makes up for it with its rich heritage and picturesque surroundings.|Agnes G|We were welcomed by a drum ensemble upon entrance; it felt very grand.

It was nostalgic to roam the whole place and watch the different performances of arnis and some Philippine dances.|Sydney G|The architecture and structural design were admirable, especially with the military equipment still visible. Seeing the view (the harbor and islands) from a different angle made our visit to Fort San Pedro memorable. Together with the band and dancers, they created a nostalgic and lively atmosphere.|Stella B|Fort San Pedro is a historical place located in Cebu City. We went there during our Gabii sa Kabilin event. Although I’ve been in Cebu many times and passed by there, I never got the chance to go inside the place. When my friends and I went there, we got to see old bikes, cannons, and we realized that the area has corals and some parts are made out of egg shells! There were also paintings of past events in Cebu city. It is a nice area to chill and learn about the history of Cebu City and the Philippines.|Anna Angelika S|The area is quite beautiful especially at night. We had a great time there. Our ride on the tartanilla was enjoyable as well.|Alyssa Magno|The museum situated inside the fort's walls was definitely the highlight of the visit. Ancient weapons, ceramics, and works of art were among the remarkable array of objects on display in the exhibits. Each exhibit gave me a glimpse into Cebu's colorful past and advanced my understanding of the area's history and cultural traditions.|Francheska C|My visit to Fort San Pedro was truly memorable.

It provided a glimpse into the  military defense structure before such as the cannons, watchtowers, and the prison.|Waldo Manalang|Fort San Pedro is a historical gem in Cebu City, Philippines. Its well-preserved walls and structures take visitors on a journey to the Spanish colonial era. The fort's rich history and picturesque surroundings make it a must-visit destination especially with the numerous staff who cosplayed what soldiers in that time also looked like roaming the walls like the the Spanish colonial era."

When we were there the only thing we said was omg what beautiful. It was nice you can also can swim in the very blue lagoon and of course standing under the waterfall... Love it!|Liau Yuan Wei|After the Oslob Whale Shark Tour, our tour guide Giselle brought us to Tumalog Falls, which is a short drive from there. Note that 4-wheels will have stop at a certain point; then either you walk 3km to the falls, or you pay 150 pesos for motorbike ride to & fro the falls (You pay only when u made the return trip back from the falls). Reason is because the road ahead is too steep for 4-wheels to drive, only the motorbikes there have enough horsepower to carry tourists there. It’s a very beautiful fall and you can take lots of nice pictures with the waterfall! There’s also a small pond with small fishes, then you can dip your feet in for the fishes to bite off your dead skin from your feet! We spent a lot of time there posing for pictures (At least 45mins). Yet again, I think you should go early in morning to beat the crowd, and transport wise it’s best to have a private vehicle bringing you near the falls! We literally wore the swimwear we had from the whale shark tour to the falls, just like the other tourists we saw.|Summers On Wheels|The falls were actually better than expected. The water was cold but refreshing.Having to use a bike to get up the hill was annoying but it isn’t mandatory or even that expensive considering how steep that hill is.I highly recommend this place for family.Don’t plan on spending more than 1-2 hours here.|Trang N|This is a beautiful water fall, although it is not that big but I love it. Water is so nice, I stood right under the stream and felt so rejuvenated. I hiked up and down the road, great exercise too|L11|Beautiful falls which are down a very steep hill - cars can’t go down it so there are lots of motorbikes waiting to take you down and up for 50 pesos each way. You can walk like we did which isn’t that bad. The falls are beautiful and weren’t too busy when we visited. You are able to swim in the pool - it is rather cold! Very impressive size and natural beauty. Not too developed which is good to see.|Mark K|it's a bit of a hike to go see, but so worth it to swim and see how beautiful these falls our. We took a van and have about 15+ family members to enjoy it.|uzmelissa|One of the best waterfalls I'have seen before and it's a bonus to swim inside, no need do canyonering just you're there in couple minutes. Easy to visit place, and it takes you from this world.|joywu1001|The most magnificent waterfall I have ever seen! The whole place reminded me of scenes from Avatar! You can get in the water if you want, but it was a bit chilly for me. Bring a towel if you plan to get wet. It's just 10 minutes from the Oslob whale sharks, and no walking required at all! The locals take you right to the waterfall on motorbike (around 5 minutes) from the parking area. Must go if in the area!!!|Traveling Ammonite|Really fun, scenic waterfalls that you could spend fifteen minutes or an hour in, depending on how you feel. I sat here for an hour, resting my legs in the water or playing in the waterfall. It was absolutely lovely. I was able to catch it when it was super busy, and another time when I was one of the only people there.|Rob B|Our family and kids used to take all of our visitors to this place right after the finished seeing the whale sharks in Oslob. But at some point before the pandemic the water flow was down to nothing and it was not a great place to visit. Now however, all that has changed for the better. The water flow is not only great it's exceptional making for a super high, huge and majestic waterfall. It's a little strong to stand directly under the main falls but there are other smaller ones adjacent you can enjoy on your body.  The falls are breathtaking and a true prize in nature. Anyone going to see the whale sharks MUST make a side trip here. In addition to the water falls the area in general is well maintained and they are improving and beautifying the facilities there. You will need to take a motorcycle down to the falls and up from the falls as the roads are steep canyons and they really shouldn't allow cars there to preserve this place a a sanctuary. Although the motorcycle ride was a bit of a thrill ride all by itself it was well organized and inexpensive transportation.  Don't walk it, going down is fine but going up may kill you lol.  As a local, I am impressed and excited for the efforts of restoration and organization that it has undergone. It was much needed to preserve the magnificence of this place."

Its  a beautiful, clean and safe place to go to shop, relax and dine with friends and family.|Mark K|We came here off the 3rd Mactan Cebu Bridge, so close, worth the experience to travel on such a nice bridge and be close to the mall.  This is like any other great SM mall, BUT... they have a skiing rink in a tropical country.  Not the best ice, or skates but worth the fun with my Pinoy niece and nephews.  Make sure to ask for Hockey Stakes, they are more like western skates.|Kozi Tsen|Very big mall in Cebu with a circular floor plan. My main concern is the ATM and toilets. For the ATM, there was a time when ALL of the ATM was not available and no directions posted in the machines as to where else we can find another ATM available. As a result, we have to go around asking other people for help. No computer mall directory. The same with toilets, I don't know why they don't have toilet paper for the comfort of their customers. Sometimes they also run out of handsoap! This is one of the largest mall in the world and yet no toilet paper, no bidet, no handsoap!|extravelagent|Although one of the biggest within the top 10, I like it alot as it's manageable. Chess, archery, great eats, scooters, massage chairs, but most of all it was all walkable within reason! Best of all free a/c bus to Fuente Circle and SM Cebu.Like all other malls it has tons of shopping, cinemas and grocery store. But the free bus was waht I liked as it got me to the circle where my hotel was and totally left on time and was clean. Thumbs up!|Ted C|The mall is so large you will need a full day here, we visited twice in two days, plenty of variety and food outlets (avoid KFC the service is terrible,  Chow king chaotic but ok) the views from this mall alone, makes it worth a visit. Now that the third bridge is open its just a relaxed 15 minute drive to Cordova avoiding the mayhem of Cebu and Lapu Lapu traffic.|Irish Mae|So far the best Mall in Cebu I have been. There are wide selections of restaurants, fast food, branded stores compared to Ayala.SM Seaside is very spacious, their rooftop is a must place to visit where you will feel the breeze of fresh air and sea view with mountain view.|Cathdee809|Mall is definitely huge!!! Easily get lost if it is first time😂 Love the variety of shops and huge parking area below and it is for free!|irenevff|been here again since 5 years ago and the place is still under expansion. when will it ever stop? there are still a lot of stalls that need to be occupied. funny seeing the skating rink almost empty at this time of the year. consequence of the pandemic.the cube at the facade (facing the ocean) is quite an attraction. biggest hollow cube i've seen so far. must be the counterpart of the sphere seen in SM MOA in pasay city, metro manila. would there be a 3D heart sculpture or a triangle spawning soon? SM can do it all, i guess.|Nico Samneil Sy Salado|Alot of spaces still needed to be leased.

What set it apart was the tablet they will lend you (in my case I was reminded by the guard to get one since I'm halfway already when they noticed I don't have one) which serves as your personal tour guide which is played by one of the residents (reenactment) of the old house.vThe ground floor is air-conditioned and was okay. But going up the 2nd floor, you will get to experience what the early Cebuanos (the rich ones at least) experienced during their time. No Air-conditioning but lots of windows and ways to cool down. I really felt like I was taken back in time every room I enter while playing the appropriate voice and video caption per area of the house. The narration and stories really get me connected to the house as I take every step to every corner. Lastly, my enjoyable visit would not be possible if not for the kind and professional staffs, specially kuya Guard. Will definitely come back here withy family.|Meg Edelveiss D|Aside from the fact that the place was very aesthetic, the interior as well as the structure of this museum will make anyone awestruck.|Francis Demetri A|Casa Gorordo Museum in Cebu City is a captivating journey into the region's cultural heritage.

It's a must-visit gem that showcases the rich history of the Philippines with passion and authenticity. The staff at Casa Gorordo Museum are incredibly passionate and well-informed. They are more than happy to answer any questions and share intriguing anecdotes about the house and its history. Their dedication to preserving and promoting local heritage is commendable and adds a layer of authenticity to the overall experience.|Vinabel Felisilda|One of the living historical sites that maintain Cebu's rich history, culture, and tradition is the Casa Gorordo Museum. The two-story house's construction with stone blocks, hardwood flooring, and treasures inside greatly astounded me. Every time I see those beautiful pieces on exhibit, it takes me on a fascinating voyage through time. With that, I can say, it is truly an art!|Meg Edelveiss D|The place spoke volumes of Cebu's heritage and it was nostalgic roaming all over the place. The staff were also very accommodating and there were also some amazing performances of arnis and some Philippine dances as well.|Agnes G|Entering the building felt like we time travelled to hundreds of years ago. The building design wasn't the only thing that was old-fashioned, but also the furniture inside. Equipment used by the country during the old times were displayed, and it was very fascinating to see.|Stella B|Casa Gorordo is a museum located at the heart of Cebu City. We visited the museum during our Gabii sa Kabilin event. There were a lot of people in the museum and yet, the staff handled the crowd professionally as there were lines and a clear area on where to enter and exit the museum. The museum was full of wonderful artifacts, from history to religion, and we really had a great time there. The balcony of the museum feels like we’re living in the past, just like the women in the past waiting for their lovers to make harana. There was also a Bo’s coffee where people could sit and have a good time after visiting. Balik batik was also there and we got to try on filipinianas and take great pictures. All in all, it is indeed a must visit when touring in Cebu City.|Hans Y|To experience going to a museum in casa corordo made feel like going back to the past and learning more about them.|Kiar|The place was beautiful and interesting. I haven't really gone to musuems in Cebu, so this was a great first stop. The artifacts were well preserved and I particularly liked the different dishware and cooking pots. My only problem was the place was really really crowded, but this was more so our problem than the museums. Once we stepped out on to the garden however, the air felt great and the food stalls were tasty. Would definitely go here again.|Sydney G|We weren't able to completely appreciate and explore the museum because there were so many people, but despite the limited time, we were equally as impressed with the artworks. One of the must-see displays was a glow-in-the-dark artwork. In addition, the museum itself was a work of art. The museum's architecture and design could transport you to another period!|Alexis T|Upon entering the museum, I was immediately struck by the sense of history that enveloped the space. The well-preserved architecture, ornate furniture, and meticulous attention to detail created an authentic atmosphere that effortlessly transported me to a bygone era. The knowledgeable and passionate staff members were eager to share the stories behind each item, further enriching my understanding of the family's lineage and the significance of the artifacts on display. The museum's commitment to authenticity and preservation was evident throughout. The family's personal belongings, photographs, and letters were carefully curated, providing a personal connection to the past. It was truly remarkable to witness how the museum seamlessly blended historical significance with intimate family stories, creating a profound sense of connection and empathy with the people who once called this house their home.|Faith S|The house was perfectly preserve, leading us into being more intruiged compared to the other exhibitions. So much history, as well as mystery lies within each step along with the fascinating introduction of Filipino culture reflected through the statues located at the first floor. The paintings and in inheritance, even with the simpliest notebook, showed presence of life and privilege in the past. Not to mention the cafe at the end of the tour being a perfect cherry on top as it helped us rest and encapsulate the beauty of such Casa.|Nev Leanne Apolonio|My experience at Casa Gorordo during the Gabii sa Kabilin event in Cebu was truly unforgettable. The historic ambiance of Casa Gorordo perfectly complemented the evening's cultural festivities. The interactive exhibits and guided tours provided fascinating insights into the rich heritage and traditions of Cebu. The tour transported me back in time and left me with a deep appreciation for Cebuano culture. Overall, Gabii sa Kabilin at Casa Gorordo was a captivating and enlightening experience that I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Cebu.|Glide Deniere|Me and my groupmates had a lot of fun during our visit to the museum last May 12, 2023. Being there gave us an amazing experience and more knowledge about history.|Alyssa Magno|I loved how Casa Gorordo was beautifully preserved and still felt like a home rather than a museum. It was such a great experience to visit here and have a glimpse of what the past was like.|Czanine J|A trip to the past where our current culture is diverse and came from our previous ancestors. The classical designs is way of making us look back to our past culture and way of living.|Elthea Vinnah|The house is very nice because of its architectural beauty. It is well preserved Spanish colonial house with wooden floors, antiques, furnitures, and intricate details.|Neil Allen B|This place was truly amazing. I was amazed by how well-maintained the house was. Even the artifacts, silverware, and all the pieces of stuff in the house. I'd surely come back here|Kristine Joy Di... T|I really love the aesthetic of the house, both its architecture and its interior design! The azotea also showed great view for travelers to take pictures in!"
Jumalon Butterfly Sanctuary,Nature & Parks, ₱100.00 ,"J.N. Jumalon Street, Cebu City 6000 Philippines",105,4.0,"shauna lynn R|When we arrived the owner was in a meeting but a former employee who was visiting offered to take us on a tour. Later the owner who is the son of Julian N. Jumalon came and told us some more about his father and his amazing work. Both were so knowledgeable, answered our questions, and gave us so much information. We saw many caterpillars, pupae, and butterflies before going to see the collection of specimens from around the world and then to the building that houses the art. Lepido mosaic is art made from butterfly wings which is very impressive and beautiful but there is also many paintings. These folks really care about keeping this place going and preserving the life work of Julian N. Jumalon. I would definitely recomend checking it out.|Beatriz F|I first visited Jumalon Butterfly Sanctuary in 2000.  I met the owner Mr. Julian Jumalon. He was 90 years old. I learned about the Sanctuary from his daughter, Dr. Humaida Jumalon who I met at Baha'i Conference at the University in Puerto Princesa. Her father was kind and so knowledgeable about butterflies and moths.  He gave me a tour of his art gallery.  We had tea and wonderful conversation.  It was one of the most peaceful places I visited in the Philippines!!  At that moment, it was difficult to imagine it had been severely destroyed by those who initiated World War II. The suffering seemed so far away. I learned so much from him!  And, I will return again!.|Adrian S|Really worth going - many beautiful butterflies. The manager is very knowledgeable and has lots of stories to tell!|Mr_Biyahero|While in Cebu city I searched best place to visit, and the butterfly sanctuary seemed interesting. My girlfriend and I spent the day roaming Cebu, eventually getting to the sanctuary. Spending time at the sanctuary with Miss Jumalon was such an incredible experience she took us through the sanctuary showing us her extensive butterfly/insect display, showing all the beautiful art and contribution to science her father (Julian Jumalon) made. We learnt a lot and we were lucky enough to have a one on one educational experience with Miss Jumalon. I could not speak more highly of this place and Miss Jumalon herself. One of a kind experience that I am glad to have lived. Hopefully more people discover this gem of Cebu.|Scenic788463|Unfortunately when I went there were not many butterflies. They run an open garden, not one completely enclosed by netting, as many other places do, so the butterflies are free to come and go. Despite this, the lady showing us around (daughter of the founder), was such an amazing source of information. She explained everything about butterflies, caterpillars, their lifecycle, different types of butterfly, etc. I learned a lot and it is always a pleasure to listen to someone who has such a passion for their subject. I definitely recommend this place. The complete tour is around 1hr.|evamH8572HA|The place is not as spectacular one like in Singapore or Thailand. It even has limited parking and very close proximity to small residences. But if you are interested to learn about butterflies species that graced and lived in Cebu City, visit this place.|Leigh K|What a disappointing place...Someone's house, with some butterflies flying around, tour guide was a young girl still at school.After the garden tour you are taken inside the house, 1 room to be exact, and shown different types of butterflies, beetles & other insects which have been preserved in picture frames.Last part of the tour we were taken into the art gallery... well taken into a room with some pictures on the wall.Wouldn't recommend at al..|Non s|I thoroughly enjoyed my visit at the butterfly sanctuary. I do wish I had brought bug spray as the mosquitoes are prevalent in the heavily shrubbed garden for the butterflies. And this is their rainy season as well.  The young man, who is an intern there, gave me my tour. I went on a Sunday morning while everyone was at church so it was basically a private tour as I was the only one there during that time so that was nice.  It is basically like a small home with a large garden that happens to have dozens of butterflies living there.  They keep the caterpillars in an enclosure to allow them to become butterflies so prey does not get to them as many of the butterflies are endangered of becoming extinct. So many already are, with just a few different types left. I went inside after my tour of the garden and was able to meet one of Jumalon’s sons. He was nice and knowledgeable and showed me some more about the work they do there. Much of the art made there is made of old butterfly wings. It’s really quite cool.  I’m not sure small children would enjoy this but it’s great for older kids and adults.  Spent about 45 minutes there.|mary jean N|the place is one of the tourists attractions yet it needs improvement to really attracts visitors. the gift shop is quite outdated and pricey. But their restroom is quite clean.|Anthony L|Was worried when the taxi driver did not know where it was in a small city like Cebu you'd expect them to know. Its really someones house with a large garden. Was a interesting talk on the history of the collection, but there was little for small children to see as there were not many butterfly's.If you have a couple of hours to stare visiting is an option, but make sure you take bug spray for walking round the garden."
Kawasan Falls,Nature & Parks, ₱45.00 ,"Matutinao, Badian 6031 Philippines",1936,4.0,"Roger K|Good time!!  It's fun. A bit touristy but it's a good experience.  Add the Whale Shark tourist trap and it makes for a good time.|Liau Yuan Wei|There are many different tour groups offering canyoneering at Kawasan Falls, for us we booked via the owner of Cuesta Resort (where we were staying). Cost is 1500 pesos + 1000 pesos for Zipline straight to starting point, which we didn’t. Must do with a local tour guide (Don’t go off on your own) because they really know where’s the safe path at through the canyon. We wore the life-vests and helmets provided for by the resort and took a minivan there (Was about 15mins/5km away). We then walked about 20mins in to the starting point (can’t drive in as there’s no gravel road, just a small trekking path), where we saw chickens and goats! We didn’t want to spend so much money on the Zipline so we didn’t take, although the group ahead of us said it was crazily fun! The canyoneering itself was one of the most exhilarating adventure we had! We trekked through the river, walking on rocks and swimming in the river at certain parts, and we jumped off at 6 different spots during the walk. The jumps ranges from easy 2m jumps to a 15m jump near the end. There was supposedly a 20m jump at the last waterfall but our guide didn’t allow us to jump as the water wasn’t deep enough to cushion our fall. We had a hell of time jumping off, especially at the 15m jump as I keep climbing up the cliff to jump 2x! There was also a swing where u pay 10 pesos to swing your body to the river and let go. Our tour guide was also nice to help us take photos with my phone and he knew the best scenic spots to take pictures at! I paid 150 pesos to buy a waterproof pouch at the resort. Overall, I highly recommend this activity, but please be physically okay because there is a lot of walking. My Apple Watch told me we walked for at least 6km. Attire: We wore swimming trunks & wet shoes, which on hindsight was abit crazy because we had microcuts on our bodies & legs while climbing through the rocks. What the guide wore make the best sense for protection - Swimsuit + Long swimming pants.|Christian A|It was an amazing experience. The beauty of the place is overwhelming and the water is so clean and cold. It is one of the best adventure we had.|Joyce B|The adventure experience I've been trough was amazing cant wait to be there again with my special someone.

You just have to make sure that your knees are prepared for their stairs, one of the visitors I saw as an elderly and they did not proceed because it's too high and they got tired in the middle so they let their young adults go to the temple on their own. I can say that it's worth it once you reach the top, you'll see a beautiful view and the architecture is really admiring but also please respect the rules as it's a place of worship. There's also an assigned police in the area when we went there.|Simon C|This is worth a visit and a climb – its surprisingly steep. Its an impressive building and series of praying areas. Tourists are encouraged to visit but there is very little information about the temple or the religion, the only interaction is with the somewhat authorisation temple helpers holding up signs to ask you to wear a face mask (really?  - and its outdoors when its not legal requirement).   I would have welcomed an explanation of the “kidney beans”, which provides a yes, no, maybe answer to a question you pose, but at first sight, it does seem to be merely an example of probability theory rather than evidence of a higher being.|Chi_Tiff|While I enjoyed my visit, you can see the entire thing in about ten minutes. I wasn’t allowed in the temple itself because I was wearing shorts and my shoulda were exposed, so if you want to enter this is something to be mindful of. It was alright but there are definitely better things to see/spend your money and time on.|DrNBA|This view of Beverly Hills in Cebu is breathtaking! Very nice and clean, quite space to meditate as well.|loo c|Taoist Temple is a popular attraction located in Cebu City, Philippines. It is a beautiful and serene temple that reflects the Taoist philosophy and religion. Here's a detailed review of the temple:The Taoist Temple in Cebu City is a peaceful and contemplative place that offers a glimpse into the Taoist religion and philosophy. The temple was built in 1972 by Cebu's substantial Chinese community, and it is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the city.The temple complex is located in Beverly Hills Subdivision, and it features a beautiful entrance gate that opens up to a flight of stairs leading up to the temple's main courtyard. The stairs are 81 steps long, representing the 81 chapters of the Taoist scriptures.Upon reaching the top, visitors are greeted by a well-maintained and beautifully landscaped courtyard that is filled with symbolic images and sculptures that are significant to the Taoist religion. The temple is ornately decorated with traditional Chinese designs, intricate carvings, and colorful paintings.One of the most significant features of the temple is the ""Wishing Well,"" where visitors can toss two stones into the well while making a wish. If the stones land inside the circle, it is believed that their wishes will come true.Another important attraction is the Dragon's Head and Dragon's Tail, which is said to bring good luck and fortune to visitors who touch them. Visitors must climb the stairs to the temple's main altar to see the beautifully crafted and colorful Taoist deities, such as the ""Thousand-Hand Guanyin"" and the ""Three Pure Ones.""While the temple is open to the public, it is important to respect the temple's rules and customs. Visitors are required to remove their shoes before entering the temple, and they are not allowed to take photos or videos inside the temple's main altar.In terms of the temple's ambiance, the Taoist Temple offers a peaceful and serene atmosphere that is perfect for meditation and reflection. The temple's courtyard is surrounded by lush greenery and offers a panoramic view of the city, making it an ideal spot for nature lovers and photography enthusiasts.The temple is also known for its fortune-telling activities. Visitors can pay for a consultation with a Taoist monk who can predict their future by interpreting the patterns made by a bundle of 50 sticks. While this is an optional activity, it is an interesting and unique experience for those interested in the Taoist religion and its practices.Overall, the Taoist Temple is a fascinating and beautiful attraction in Cebu City that offers visitors a glimpse into the Taoist religion and philosophy. With its intricate architecture, beautiful landscapes, and serene ambiance, the temple is an ideal destination for those seeking spiritual enlightenment, cultural immersion, and a unique travel experience|richj65|A beautiful Oasis on top of the hill.

Just a 20 minute boat ride away (depending on where you leave from Bantayan) and you are greeted by a pearly white beach. Downside is that everything on the island is rentable.

It’s crowded but the ambience was very tranquil.|Peter M|Santo Niño Basilica, is a basilica in Cebu City  was founded in 1565  and is  the oldest Roman Catholic church in the country, It is very close to Magellan's cross|Oscardog16|Historical location  that is important to the citizens. Pedestrian traffic is well controlled so as worshippers are not disturbed,|uzmelissa|Spanish historic effects at this church is a very good symbol of their religious sites in Cebu. A nice walking distance all other historic spots and feel warm feelings inside|Reslimpan|Interesting to visit and see. It has historical significance. I realize I need to study more about Philippines history prior to the arrival of Magellan. It appears to me that the Philippines didn’t really exist until the catholics arrived, that just don’t feel right. The basilica among the worldwide population of such buildings are average at best.|thefilipinotraveler|This is the oldest church in the country so it has a lot of history including having the oldest religious image (image of Sto. Nino de Cebu). As a Roman Catholic, I have visited it a few times and would really recommend it to other Christians.|Ricoy|Everytime I go to Cebu for business or pleasure, I always try to drop by the Basilica to say my prayers of gratitude to the Mahal na Sto.Nino. For his bountiful blessings and for taking good care for me and my family.|lovehols|Well worth visiting. The doll-like image of Jesus is there to see. It's as old as Magellan, dating back to 1521. The rest of the building, dating back to 1565, will astound.|A Santiago|Place is rich in history and cultural heritage! it's amazing how they've maintained it after all these years.|Von Geraldizo|If your a roman catholic or curious with Philippines dominant religion then you’ve come to the right place. This church is very rich with history and cultural heritage.|lara|I went here with my mother. I can say that it was a very beautiful memory to cherish because churches, especially like the Basilica del Santo Nino, which is a part of our history as well way back the colonization of the Spaniards, have different hit in my heart, considering how well maintained and beautiful it was when I got there inside and out, and it is still has its beauty up until today for sure. I enjoyed exploring the façade of the church and how it looks incredibly great inside. All in all the experience was great, I hope I could visit the Basilica again soon.|London-Phil|As there are many such reviews on the Basilica del Santo Nino here on TA, I thought I might offer a slightly different perspective on such a well visited subject. I visited the Basilica del Santo Nino whilst in Cebu in March 2020, when everything was still open thankfully so I was able to walk freely around.It is certainly impressive, especially when viewed in the context of the poverty of the docks/piers which are but a short stroll away. I know this, because I spent hours walking through both on the day I visited. I am used to poverty overseas, but found the very young girls (children), clearly with their own young babies, especially upsetting. I make this observation only because of the very visible difference between the prosperity of the two factions, and not as a specific criticism of either.   The Basilica del Santo Nino, is a beautiful Catholic Church, located in the downtown area of Cebu City, next to the Magellan Cross which, is another highly visited tourist point. As is usual for me, the most compelling and therefore memorable aspect of my visit was the human interaction enjoyed, this rather than the glitz and glory of the main building itself.I remember well, a smiley Lady of some advanced years, in yellow (see pics), attempting to sell me some candles. Unfortunately, I had just purchased a large, Holy candle from the Church shop, this for a friend back in the UK who is considerably more devout than I am. So sadly in this case, I felt unable to accommodate her request to buy more.I did however ask, if she might like to come home to the UK with me as I was both alone abroad and sadly, unloved at home. Alas, she broke my heart and we subsequently parted with the cheeriest of laughs and giggles being exchanged between us. The point I'm really trying to make here is a simple one. Yes, the building is beautiful and clearly, religiously significant. I am myself a Catholic who studied theology when younger. The real beauty for me however, will always be the people who inhabit and visit these sites rather than the bricks, mortar and Gold in this instance, that was required to build them. Over the years, I have been to many such Grand Places of Worship, and the thoughts and memories that have lingered the longest, have always been centred around conversations enjoyed whilst there, rather than the Grandeur of the places themselves. In which case, if ever given the opportunity, go and explore the Basilica del Santo Nino and enjoy the beauty that is self-evident from near every corner and angle. Above all else though, bring some money for the truly lovely Lady in yellow, as I have absolutely no doubt, she will still be there and asking if you might buy her candles. Remember to smile when you speak, as you just never know where the next life affirming conversation will come from, even when you don't actually speak the same language. That for me, is the true beauty and wonder, of Travel! As always, happy and safe travelling. Phil|Francis_Elvis_Verdin|A Place that you could remember the resemblance of how we invade by Spaniards the Philippines for almost 333 years.|ScambusterSZ|While we couldn't get in, we had a nice walk around as part of longer walk around the village. It between the main drag through town and the ocean front. You can also see the museum nearby.|Roger M|A beautiful place in which to contemplate your inner self. Can never visit Cebu without spending a few minutes in this holy place."
