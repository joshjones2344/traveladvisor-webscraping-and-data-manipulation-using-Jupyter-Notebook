Can't wait to be back there for my last night in Cebu tomorrow! Here is why: -the check-in was smooth and fast.  -ideally situated right next to Ayala Center -staff at the concierge is very knowledgeable and knows how to help people and give good advices. -the room is BIG! And overall good cleanliness. It was not ""spotless"" because the hotel is not new. Some things look used but absolutely not dirty. We asked for more toilet paper and the houseman who came saw that we had no bottles of water (actually we put them in the fridge haha) so he brought us two extra more without us asking anything. Good hotelier sense! -the breakfast was A-MA-ZING. Lots of choices to please every client (asian + western dishes) -we also used the\\bob1cat\\We stayed two nights at the Mandarin Plaza hotel which is about 300M walk to the Ayala mall if you need to go shopping.  The hotel does not have a shuttle to the airport or harbor for ferry service but taxi's are available for 250 - 500 pesos.  The breakfast buffet was better than we expected with both hot and cold items to choose from. Refills were no problem.  A few items on the buffet change daily.  If we needed to visit the Ayala mall we would stay there again.\\Olivia d\\This hotel is fabulous, not only is it centrally located but the hotel has everything you want..reasonably priced, spotless rooms, great showers and good wifi. The hotel has a pool, sauna and restaurant. We ate here two nights and the food was delicious and cheap too. The staff were what made the stay however, they were so helpful and friendly, from the concierge to the wait staff. So thank-you!\\Teresa B\\The room was spacious, clean and the food at breakfast was alright. Though at the time of checking in there was one lady on duty, it took a little bit of time to get my turn in the queue, but at least she gave me the room on the 17th floor. It was quiet and good view of the city lights.\\livi88\\Good standard hotel. Room Was clean and comfortable. Food is average but very reasonable. Very friendly staff. Ideal location for Cebu city - directly across from the mall. Not a whole heap to do in Cebu city itself but good location to do day trips from.\\Cameron B\\On my first impression of the room was wow...it was a great size, very spacious. Staff were always friendly and helpful, especially when i asked for a TV remote control, as the rooms only come with a cable TV remote and i wanted to play media from my personal hard drive. Buffet breakfast was good, plenty of choices, both western and Asian cuisine available...the only negative i found was the bacon...not everyone likes crispy bacon. Location is great, a short walk to Ayala Mall and the must try House of Lechon (it was so good i went back 2 nights in a row) Pool was good, gym was a little hard to find (not that i used it) Overall i enjoyed my stay at the Mandarin Plaza Hotel and when i visit Cebu again, i wont hesitate booking here again.\\CheriedPretty\\My mother and I stayed in this hotel overnight and boy, I was surprised how the hotel's interior design and magnificent color mesmerized me. the entrance lobby looked so grand with crystal chandelier hanging over an oversized centerpiece. The room (superior room) was equipped with ref, hair dryer, slippers, laundry bags, and complimentary drinks. Although there was nothing on the bar, still i appreciate the cleanliness and orderliness of the entire room. The room service was prompt and the restaurant was open until 11:30PM! The food selection was not many but sufficently delicious and varied...there are cereals and congee for the kids too. the breads are fresh. This hotel definitely deserve my second visit!\\Arra Ezekiel N\\Pro - Near shopping center / Ayala IT Park (3-5 mins walk) - Near the pier (20mins by car) - Food is great - Accommodating and very kind staff - Clean and spacious room and toilet. - taxis are lined up outside - fast internet connection  Cons - Same breakfast menu everyday (buffet) - When I stayed there last April 1 2018, the bedsheets had stains and the bath towel was frayed and torn - 45mins travel from the airport\\Dorothy W\\Really enjoyed my stay here. Warm friendly welcome. The hotel is close to Ayala mall which has a large selection of shops, bars and restaurants. Room very clean and communal areas. Staff helpful and professional.\\Richard H\\First, let me speak of the hotel. This was my second stay, and it would have been my third, had they not been booked up on my last minute trip a month before. I love this place and the staff, not to mention the close proximity to the large mall. I’ve done a lot of traveling in the U.S. and across Asia. Often, even nice places have flaws and aging, especially in the bathrooms. This place is always spotless and in excellent condition. On this stay, I needed a toothbrush, and seeing an employee in the hall, mentioned it. She wasn’t a housekeeper and didn’t have anything with her, but when I returned to my room, two toothbrushes and extra T/P awaited me. Now, for the rave. I was extremely stressed on this trip and did something totally out of character: I left my passport and PHP\\Steve J\\I travel...A LOT!  This was my first stay at the Mandarin, and I will be back! It is conveniently located to Ayala Mall and many other Cebuano musts...like great cuisine and professional massage parlors, such as Nuai Thai, just a stones throw from the Mandarin, but well worth the short walk.    I arrived late at night from the USA, so a speedy, helpful, and friendly check-in process was a must. Justine and Christian made this possible! My room was clean, comfortable, and the aircon was good...but not great. The bed was amazing, and the WiFi way more than adequate! The rooms are also very spacious, which is helpful since most international travelers arrive with a lot of luggage.    The breakfast buffet, which is included with your room, was very good, and the pancit canton I had\\loida gac-ang\\I enjoyed while staying at this beautiful place.They have yummy and unlimitted food.Good ambiance at the dining place. Accomodating staff and crew. The place were very nice and so accessible because it is located near the mall.\\JinDee8\\We enjoyed our stay at the Mandarin Plaza. Our room was very spacious, and we really appreciated the complimentary bottled water, and coffee bar. The hotel was nice and clean, and staff was friendly and accommodating. Our only gripe is the limited selection for the breakfast buffet, but we are grateful that they even offer it for free, so can't really complain. We recommend this hotel, especially if you want to be close to Ayala Center.\\Marlaine Hope R\\Aside from booking a room for an affordable price, the place was huge and just enough for my active two year old son to run around to his heart content. Cozy and spacious. Breakfast was a buffet of sumptuous food. A feast for my eyes and stomach early in the morning.\\Aggeliki K\\Beautiful hotel with nice rooms and pleasant environment, tight in the central of the city. I tried the cocktails at night with relaxing live piano music. The rooms are quite big and nice, and friendly staff.\\Patricia P\\Loved staying at this hotel.  Breakfast buffet was fantastic with different food options available.  Room service facilities excellent, such as house slippers and bag for groceries.  Tea and coffee with fresh water provided every day.\\Nicx\\This hotel is value for money. It's hard to find a hotel in the heart of Cebu City with a bath tub for two thousand pesos. The hotel is clean, big, with free breakfast, tasty in-room dining service, walking distance to a mall, with pool, bar, restaurant and friendly staff. Will come back if I am in Cebu again.\\Seaside750551\\They are very strict with the check in and out times, but they have great rooms and facilities and delicious buffet. The location is convenient to Ayala Malls but a bit crowded. I would recommend this.\\The Aimless traveller\\If you’re a solo or business traveler needing peace and quiet, keep in mind that it’s full of group tourists and families, and in a crowded part of Cebu. Otherwise it’s an excellent comfortable hotel with all amenities, good breakfast and polite staff.\\Judfae M\\I checked in on July 7 and out on the 9th with a friend. I was surprised by the spacious room with basic amenities. You can have the other needs upon request.   I thought the rate would be much higher..but it was affordable.  It was easy for us to go to and from Ayala, Cebu as it was just across the street.    Hotel staff and maintenance were friendly and professional.  Buffet breakfast was really nothing extraordinary..but just fine for what you pay. I would still look forward to staying in the same hotel in the future.",,,,,,,Alcoy,60,1,Alcoy,19K,Bisaya,English,"Bus,Trikes,Jeepney,UV,Taxi,BoatRental"

Sophisticated and elegant but reasonably priced hotel.   Big room, clean, spacious, well lighted with modern design/theme. Although, bathroom fixtures maybe improved.   Breakfast offering/selection was above average. I felt the food was prepared with love because they were all tasty. The ham with mango glazed and spanish style bangus were delicious.

For the past 6 years every time I traveled to Robinsons Galleria Cebu for shopping, dining, and watching movies, I already have Summit Hotels and Resorts on my bucket list. When the pandemic broke up, with strict health protocols to follow, it was hard to travel abroad. From then on, I've decided to be a local tourist guest of my own City/Province and experience Cebuano hospitality to help the tourism industry which is badly affected.

Clean and comfy beds. Good AC, right water  pressure and heater is operational despite the City was impacted by super typhoon Odette where Metro Cebu has NO power and water in many areas.

All I can say is the customer service is highly appreciated, since the day I arrived until I checked out.  If I request something they immediately have an action.  The rooms was clean and the ambiance is good.  Please extend my appreciation to Mr. Jilmer Cortez.  He helped me a lot. Even buy me some medicine because my stomach felt bad! Hardworking and approachable!  For all the staffs, thank you! Salamat!\\Lc\\Superb! Had a safe, clean, and warm stay. Staff made sure to look after the cleanliness of the room a day after the beginning of the stay. Will be sure to come and will definitely try their restaurant.\\Owen McBride\\A great clean hotel with a great staff. Helpful from the time we arrived on the doorstep until we checked out. A great experience. The hotel is perfectly located adjoined to the Robinson's Galleria Mall. A very short distance away (visible in the distance) SM City, Cebu. Very very close to Pier 1 and all fast craft. The staff were very accommodating to our needs for storage space due to a variety of over-sized Balikbayan boxes. The doormen were most helpful in ""flagging"" taxis. And the PNP on the premises were a very comforting thought. The room was pristine with a great view. Thanks to the entire staff. I am looking forward to staying there again in the future.\\Ghilord baguio\\This hotel is the best in term of cleanliness and ambiance and also the location itself close to malls,churches, and Port. I did my hotel quarantine for 10 days in Summit Galleria Cebu ,my room are big with dinning area,living area, big sleeping room and Big Comfort Room, crew and staff are friendly  they are well trained about protocols and guidelines .. good job\\Ron\\I stayed here for 8 nights to quarantine as a Returning Overseas Filipino (ROI). While I cannot fault the courtesy of the staff, the food was a major letdown.  I would give better meals to the homeless on the streets. Not once during the whole stay did they serve a fruit with the meals. If you want to eat healthy and stay sane while stuck in the hotel room, I suggest that you download Food Panda on your phone and get food delivered to you from your choice of restaurants. Otherwise, the whole experience could make you feel like you are paying to stay in a fancy hotel to eat a prisoner's food. It was depressing. I did not mind eating from a disposable plate with plastic spoon and fork if this is for health reasons, but I believe that a balanced meal is essential to a person's well\\IMGlobal77749\\the hotel has excellent customer service. they respond to inquiries, concerns and request immediately. they are very accommodating. I just wish they serve better food. for a 3 day quarantine, our hotel bill is a package with 3 meals a day. but it was very small servings. for the price paid, it should have been more, with more selection and servings. apart from food, i think the hotel is good. just a little pricey compared to others. the airport to hotel transpo should also be free and included in the reservation. but they charge every single activity.\\Francis\\they have a large room, a family of three is well accommodated. the staff are very polite and friendly, the food was great as well. place is very clean and comfy. didn't had the chance to visit the pool though. internet is fast but it sometimes get disconnected.\\Mark D\\not our first time here. and not our last Pool is great Limited menu due to pandemic, yet they tried their best to accommodate... not totally disappointed  Staff makes or breaks a property Staff here is world class, above average accommodating, concerned and attentive. Very very enjoyable stay and we will go again soon\\Glenn Guinto\\The location is excellent. The room is clean. However, the Internet is really slow it's totally unusable. I used mobile data so I could work.. :(  Hot shower is not working in our room.. :( I think the shower and toilet's glass doors should swing inward, instead of outward as it blocks passage and could bump into each other.  Our booking includes ""free breakfast."" Well, it's not really free since you can book without breakfast for a cheaper price.  You don't get to choose the type of breakfast. 1st day, sausage, scrambled eggs, and rice. 2nd day, tocino, scrambled eggs and rice.  3rd day, repeat 1st day :D sausage, scrambled eggs and rice. No offence meant, but their ""free"" breakfast reminds us of the meals served in inter-island passenger/ferry ships :D To their credit, they\\Eunice Gail O\\Our stay was amazing. A good getaway from a work day.   The room was very spacious and clean. The bed waaaaaas aaaaaaawesooooooome! It was big and so comfortable. Also the room lighting and color were very pleasant to see. To add, the block out curtains are really good. ☺️\\steph_dmd\\I can attest to the great service of the banquet staff, delightful food and fabulous function hall. So thankful for Ms. Stephany Cañete for accommodating our event last sept.17 in spite this coronavirus pandemic. Our event was a success big thanks to summit staff and crews. More power to all! May you continue to fulfill and bring happiness to all that needs your services.\\aguitongleoniza\\I had a very pleasant stay with great accommodations.  Room was big and comfortable.  People were kind and always smiling.  The front desk lady was also very helpful getting a grab car en route to the airport upon checking out.\\Ricardo\\I had an enjoyable stay at the Summit Hotel because the staff are helpful, the food is good, rooms are clean and comfortable and beside a mall. I have been a guest of this hotel for several times but my last stay was the most memorable one. I have reserved in Summit Circle but was was on my mind was Galleria but although I had no reservation they accommodated me instantly. Also I forgot my cellphone charger but they have a spare charger on the front desk so I was able to charge my phone. Thanks to that..\\kiietiu\\Naiwan ko yung pera ko sa may table dun sa room , nung tinawagan ko sila nahanap nila yung pera tapos pinakuha ko nalang sa pinsan ko. Thank you so much po , highly recommended, minsan nalang yung ganyan.\\Roman III Reyes\\It's very close to my Cebu office so I stay here whenever I am in Cebu (which is about 2 weeks out of every month). Convenient because it sits atop a mall where there's an abundance of choices for meals and shopping . The mall's quite new too and has a good variety of shops for almost all your needs. The breakfast buffet is excellent also. Each room has its own WiFi router so you get a good signal all the time.  What's not so good? Really small ref in the room, and only 4 clothes hangers (they don't expect you to stay too long I guess)...\\r0mmelreyes\\i always stay at the summit  galleria every time i travel to cebu which is a weeklong stay every 2 weeks. i like its convenience to my place of work and the amenities it offers especially the shops in the mall below where i can dine and buy items i suddenly need. the breakfast buffet is also excellent.\\stiflerspeilberg\\We stayed only 1 night but the customer service was the highlight... They were so kind and helpful from the moment we got out from our van until we left... Although, there was only 1 elevator working at that time, I understood the inconvenience because they were preparing for the sinulog festival... I love that the mall is just right there... You can eat, shop anytime... i wish we could’ve stayed there for more days... Definitely one of our choices to stay in Cebu!\\Giusseppe S\\We got to the hotel at least an hour earlier than check in time but the receptionist did not make it difficult for us. she made arrangements so we could deposit our luggage at their luggage storage. Then asked us if we can allow a couple of minutes so they can check if they can allow us to check in earlier than expected. So my fiance and I just decided to grab a quick bite at the mall. Of which to my surprise, the hotel had access to where we need not go out as it was scorching hot out. After a sumptuous lunch, we can back to the hotel and our room was already ready. The room was really clean and the aircon was cold. Checking out was also a breeze.Too bad we only had time in our schedule for a one nightstay. But I would definitely be back if ever I am in the area.",,,,,,,Argao,60,4,Argao,78K,Bisaya,English,"Bus,Trikes,Jeepney,UV,Taxi,BoatRental"

I just wish they serve better food. for a 3 day quarantine, our hotel bill is a package with 3 meals a day. but it was very small servings. for the price paid, it should have been more, with more selection and servings. apart from food, i think the hotel is good. just a little pricey compared to others. the airport to hotel transpo should also be free and included in the reservation. but they charge every single activity.\\Francis\\they have a large room, a family of three is well accommodated. the staff are very polite and friendly, the food was great as well. place is very clean and comfy. didn't had the chance to visit the pool though. internet is fast but it sometimes get disconnected.\\Mark D\\not our first time here. and not our last Pool is great Limited menu due to pandemic, yet they tried their best to accommodate... not totally disappointed  Staff makes or breaks a property Staff here is world class, above average accommodating, concerned and attentive. Very very enjoyable stay and we will go again soon\\Glenn Guinto\\The location is excellent. The room is clean. However, the Internet is really slow it's totally unusable. I used mobile data so I could work.. :(  Hot shower is not working in our room.. :( I think the shower and toilet's glass doors should swing inward, instead of outward as it blocks passage and could bump into each other.  Our booking includes ""free breakfast."" Well, it's not really free since you can book without breakfast for a cheaper price.  You don't get to choose the type of breakfast. 1st day, sausage, scrambled eggs, and rice. 2nd day, tocino, scrambled eggs and rice.  3rd day, repeat 1st day :D sausage, scrambled eggs and rice. No offence meant, but their ""free"" breakfast reminds us of the meals served in inter-island passenger/ferry ships :D To their credit, they\\Eunice Gail O\\Our stay was amazing. A good getaway from a work day.   The room was very spacious and clean. The bed waaaaaas aaaaaaawesooooooome! It was big and so comfortable. Also the room lighting and color were very pleasant to see. To add, the block out curtains are really good. ☺️\\steph_dmd\\I can attest to the great service of the banquet staff, delightful food and fabulous function hall. So thankful for Ms. Stephany Cañete for accommodating our event last sept.17 in spite this coronavirus pandemic. Our event was a success big thanks to summit staff and crews. More power to all! May you continue to fulfill and bring happiness to all that needs your services.\\aguitongleoniza\\I had a very pleasant stay with great accommodations.  Room was big and comfortable.  People were kind and always smiling.  The front desk lady was also very helpful getting a grab car en route to the airport upon checking out.\\Ricardo\\I had an enjoyable stay at the Summit Hotel because the staff are helpful, the food is good, rooms are clean and comfortable and beside a mall. I have been a guest of this hotel for several times but my last stay was the most memorable one. I have reserved in Summit Circle but was was on my mind was Galleria but although I had no reservation they accommodated me instantly. Also I forgot my cellphone charger but they have a spare charger on the front desk so I was able to charge my phone. Thanks to that..\\kiietiu\\Naiwan ko yung pera ko sa may table dun sa room , nung tinawagan ko sila nahanap nila yung pera tapos pinakuha ko nalang sa pinsan ko. Thank you so much po , highly recommended, minsan nalang yung ganyan.\\Roman III Reyes\\It's very close to my Cebu office so I stay here whenever I am in Cebu (which is about 2 weeks out of every month). Convenient because it sits atop a mall where there's an abundance of choices for meals and shopping . The mall's quite new too and has a good variety of shops for almost all your needs. The breakfast buffet is excellent also. Each room has its own WiFi router so you get a good signal all the time.  What's not so good? Really small ref in the room, and only 4 clothes hangers (they don't expect you to stay too long I guess)...\\r0mmelreyes\\i always stay at the summit  galleria every time i travel to cebu which is a weeklong stay every 2 weeks. i like its convenience to my place of work and the amenities it offers especially the shops in the mall below where i can dine and buy items i suddenly need. the breakfast buffet is also excellent.\\stiflerspeilberg\\We stayed only 1 night but the customer service was the highlight... They were so kind and helpful from the moment we got out from our van until we left... Although, there was only 1 elevator working at that time, I understood the inconvenience because they were preparing for the sinulog festival... I love that the mall is just right there... You can eat, shop anytime... i wish we could’ve stayed there for more days... Definitely one of our choices to stay in Cebu!\\Giusseppe S\\We got to the hotel at least an hour earlier than check in time but the receptionist did not make it difficult for us. she made arrangements so we could deposit our luggage at their luggage storage. Then asked us if we can allow a couple of minutes so they can check if they can allow us to check in earlier than expected. So my fiance and I just decided to grab a quick bite at the mall. Of which to my surprise, the hotel had access to where we need not go out as it was scorching hot out. After a sumptuous lunch, we can back to the hotel and our room was already ready. The room was really clean and the aircon was cold. Checking out was also a breeze.Too bad we only had time in our schedule for a one nightstay. But I would definitely be back if ever I am in the area.",,,,,,,Argao,60,4,Argao,78K,Bisaya,English,"Bus,Trikes,Jeepney,UV,Taxi,BoatRental"

The staff are always on hand to help out with requests, finding transpo etc.\\Anthony Huang\\Breakfast was delicious many choices but no mangoes in the fruit section.Theresa receptionist is attentive, entertaining and knowledgeable.She is a huge asset to your restaurant. We will definitely be back soon.   A fantastic experience and highly recommended.\\Johntxspud\\Hotel location was great. The location of the room given was next to the elevator foyer where we heard the constant elevator bells and people chatting. Some event had some heavy base that vibrated all the way up to the 14th floor from 8 pm to 6 am.\\JoeyBoyCalifornia\\This hotel sets the standards for all other hotels to aim for.  Clean, safe and have staff that are simply amazing.  Every encounter was pleasant and professional. The staff truly WANT to help their guests.  This is one of the best aspects of the Radisson Blu.  The staff want the guests to be comfortable and to have a pleasant stay; They will literally bend over backwards to make it the best experience.\\iowaloves2travel\\A very nice hotel. The room had a nice desk and they were able to get me an adaptor for my usa laptop. The restaurant had many options for both breakfast and lunch. The bed was firm and the pillows were soft. My room had a walk in shower. The room was musty smelling would be the only downside. The hotel is right next to the mall very easy to walk across the street.\\Ann Carmel M\\Stayed and dined and is always a wonderful experience.

Upon booking, they charge local tax and estimated tax after you placed the credit details for booking confirmation  2.) Upon checkin, they let you wait 45mins in the queue 3.) WHEN ITS YOUR TURN, they will tell yoy, there’s no room available  4.) They then let you wait 1hr and 45 mins for yoy to go in. 5.) Pillows were bad.\\Passport39226059828\\Walking through the lobby I was immediately impressed. The service at the front desk was very professional and the room i was given was very comfortable.

And then Alexine at the buffet treated us like royalty where she surprised us with fruit and a cake in honor of celebrating my husband’s retirement! I highly recommend Radisson to anyone that is staying or visiting Cebu Philippines. Amenities and customer service was outstanding!\\larryhockaday1984\\Customer service was amazing. I stayed for 3 weeks and had no problems. The mall was across the street. Security was friendly and I felt safe. The pool bar employees remember my orders and engaged in small talk.\\michael m\\I cannot praise Radisson Hotel enough for their remarkable dining experience. The food options were diverse, and each dish was crafted with precision and creativity. The flavors were exquisite, and the presentation was a feast for the eyes. The hotel's commitment to exceptional service was epitomized by Kyle, whose attentiveness and friendly demeanor left a lasting impression.

The king bed was gigantic and very comfortable. The room was very clean. I personally picked this hotel for 2 main reason: 1. SM city is just next to the hotel. 2. I don’t want to ride a cab to take us shopping . Very accessible indeed to buy all your pasalubongs. We stayed here after our 3 1/2 week’s vacation mostly within the Visayas Islands.   We wanted to be well rested before our international flight.  We enjoyed our complimentary drinks while listening to the live music playing in the lobby/bar.

If I put excellent '5' peoe tend to think they are so good\\Otis_Jan\\Nothing else to say but amazing place to stay, hospitality is top notch and the service beyond expectation. The staffs were amazing, and the hotel is gorgeous. Loving the live music entertainment in the evening in the bar too, that was a bonus.\\I❤️banff\\We stayed here for 4D/3N. The king bed was gigantic and very comfortable. The room was very clean. I personally picked this hotel for 2 main reason: 1. SM city is just next to the hotel. 2. I don’t want to ride a cab to take us shopping . Very accessible indeed to buy all your pasalubongs. We stayed here after our 3 1/2 week’s vacation mostly within the Visayas Islands.   We wanted to be well rested before our international flight.  We enjoyed our complimentary drinks while listening to the live music playing in the lobby/bar. Night swimming was also fun with our youngest.  Perfect to end the night. We heard the breakfast buffet was the best but we opt out coz we prefer to sleep in. We made reservations for dinner buffet instead and we were not disappointed, well except for the\\dmills332\\Central location for me, as I go to the office and other locations in Cebu and Mactan. I find having SM Mall next door super handy. The staff are always on hand to help out with requests, finding transpo etc.\\Anthony Huang\\Breakfast was delicious many choices but no mangoes in the fruit section.Theresa receptionist is attentive, entertaining and knowledgeable.She is a huge asset to your restaurant. We will definitely be back soon.   A fantastic experience and highly recommended.\\Johntxspud\\Hotel location was great. The location of the room given was next to the elevator foyer where we heard the constant elevator bells and people chatting. Some event had some heavy base that vibrated all the way up to the 14th floor from 8 pm to 6 am.\\JoeyBoyCalifornia\\This hotel sets the standards for all other hotels to aim for.  Clean, safe and have staff that are simply amazing.  Every encounter was pleasant and professional. The staff truly WANT to help their guests.  This is one of the best aspects of the Radisson Blu.  The staff want the guests to be comfortable and to have a pleasant stay; They will literally bend over backwards to make it the best experience.\\iowaloves2travel\\A very nice hotel. The room had a nice desk and they were able to get me an adaptor for my usa laptop. The restaurant had many options for both breakfast and lunch. The bed was firm and the pillows were soft. My room had a walk in shower. The room was musty smelling would be the only downside. The hotel is right next to the mall very easy to walk across the street.\\Ann Carmel M\\Stayed and dined and is always a wonderful experience.

WHEN ITS YOUR TURN, they will tell yoy, there’s no room available  4.) They then let you wait 1hr and 45 mins for yoy to go in. 5.) Pillows were bad.\\Passport39226059828\\Walking through the lobby I was immediately impressed. The service at the front desk was very professional and the room i was given was very comfortable. The food at the buffet everyday was always excellent.\\KritzR3\\Recommendations:  Provide ‘do not disturb’ door knob hanger for guests privacy concerns. Additional daily unique dish for breakfast buffet, with consideration for guest with multiple night stay at the hotel.\\malianfa\\I love my short stay in your hotel and I enjoyed your amazing service.

And then Alexine at the buffet treated us like royalty where she surprised us with fruit and a cake in honor of celebrating my husband’s retirement! I highly recommend Radisson to anyone that is staying or visiting Cebu Philippines. Amenities and customer service was outstanding!\\larryhockaday1984\\Customer service was amazing. I stayed for 3 weeks and had no problems. The mall was across the street. Security was friendly and I felt safe. The pool bar employees remember my orders and engaged in small talk.\\michael m\\I cannot praise Radisson Hotel enough for their remarkable dining experience. The food options were diverse, and each dish was crafted with precision and creativity. The flavors were exquisite, and the presentation was a feast for the eyes. The hotel's commitment to exceptional service was epitomized by Kyle, whose attentiveness and friendly demeanor left a lasting impression.

We are checking into NuStar Fil hotel right after we checked out from Sheraton Mactan resort for 3 days and 3 nights. The difference between Sheraton and NuStar is like day and night when it comes to service.   We arrived in NuStar via LG parking lot. We arrived we multiple large luggage’s and although there are multiple hotel personnel standing by the x-ray machine no one dares to help us unload our stuff. After they x-rayed our bags no one guided us where to go and they just stand there and busy themselves chitchatting. We carried all our bags to the elevator.  At the check-in reception: it was very disorganized and it looks like that most personnel don’t even know what to do. While\\Iza p\\Everything is just perfect! Staff- extremely Polite and accommodating, your comfort is their Top Priority. Room- very big, even bigger (wink) is the bathroom. I like the beds and the interior of the room. Tastefully designed. Breakfast buffet- OMG this is especially wonderful. Their Menu is extensive and everything is just delicious.\\Sanitv\\I stayed here for 4 nights during recent trip to Cebu. The hotel is located in the complex with restaurants and casino. However, the mall section still under construction.  Check In and check out progress is slow but helpful staff. The room is wide and fully equipped, espacially very comfortable mattress. The breakfast was also good with varieties of western and local food.\\Angelica T\\Manager Johanne Espinosa, Head Concierge Stephen Santiago and Vince of the concierge team went above and beyond to assist guests. Even though the hotel was quite new, they responded to every request timely and attentively with a smile. Exceeded expectations for sure!\\Christopher P\\As part of the organizing council of ABAC in Cebu. I was amazed as we arrived at Fili Hotel. The hotel is modern, clean,stylish and very luxurious from lobby to convention and rooms, it was extremely elegant and spacious.The food was great too. The hotel employees were very friendly. Although, I would say that there is room for improvement in terms of service. In particular, as we were preparing  in the Convention Hall B for the plenary meeting. I requested one male wait staff for chairs to be placed in the control booth, I waited for the chairs for about 20 minutes but the guy did not come back, so I went out to the lobby and was waiting for him impatiently as we needed the chairs but I could not find him, until one female wait staff named Lyn approached me and asked if she\\Oleg Mikhailov\\I visited Cebu for the ABAC and stayed here. Excellent Service from the hotel staff, upon arrival I was given a welcoming drink by a tall pretty lady named Lyn, what caught my attention is her warm and welcoming smile. The orange fizz was refreshing by the way. The room was very spacious, clean and had the amenities needed. Breakfast was delicious and with many choices. The people in the reception were very helpful in checkin and check out. Transaction was smooth. The convention were we held the meetings was very clean and staffs were very quick to replenish water, pencils and paper. Coffee and tea was good and Lyn was there too always smiling and helpful in giving directions to spots. She also recommended Fina restaurant and food was great. The location is great and near\\NewYorkWorldExplorer\\The hotel is part of the Nustar resort in the South Reclamation area which is a few minutes away from all the tourist spots and Cebu’s business district. The rooms are sparkling new and have beautiful views of the Mactan Bridge, the water, downtown, and the hills which all light up nicely at night. The bathrooms are luxurious and all amenities are provided. The most enjoyable part of our stay was the breakfast buffet at the Fili Cafe. Food was delicious and service was top notch. At the time of our visit, the mall, the sauna and spa, and certain areas of Nustar resort were still under construction or not yet operational. I expect it to be a popular destination when the entire Nustar resort is fully operational in 2024. Thumbs up!\\Stephanie C\\I am curious about the newest & famous 5 star hotel in Cebu City! As a family, we decided to dine in FILI cafe. The name itself is classy and inviting as well. So we decided to try just this month of Julu & I was surprised by the authenticity of the food! It was soooo delish and worth every penny! PLUS, the staff named DAN who accommodated is was very witty and his services to us was outstanding! He made us feel comfortable always and he was mindful everytime we need some assistance. Dan is highly commendable if only I have more time to commend him at that moment. He is one of the best servers I have ever met! Will definitely dine again at Fili and looking forward for Dan to assist us. Kudos to the entire staff for the great service. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\\Travel@buckets\\Good modern business hotel  New facilities  Booked a sea view room  Check in was uneventful  Staff are very attentive  Some facilities are still not open at the time  Pool side has great views but there’s no bar service -(  Room ample space for 2 adults  Beds pillows are very comfortable  Breakfast was great - multiple Asian and western selections  Tried Fili restaurant which is within the premises and the food is not only good but reasonably priced  Overall stay was satisfactory , close enough to explore the City so I would stay here again.\\Lynne Smith\\This is one of the newest hotels in Cebu City, so our family opted to visit this place. The property is still under construction especially the Nustar hotel.  This place was great and you have plenty of great restaurants from Michelin star to great Steakhouse you can choose from. Also, the staff were all nice and accommodating, special mention to Jane from the front desk and to the housekeeping team who maintains our room clean and tidy. One thing I noticed though is that we kept hearing noises outside our room at some point during our stay so I figured it was not really a sound proof one. The breakfast buffet was mouthwatering even though the varieties were kinda limited.

We are checking into NuStar Fil hotel right after we checked out from Sheraton Mactan resort for 3 days and 3 nights. The difference between Sheraton and NuStar is like day and night when it comes to service.   We arrived in NuStar via LG parking lot. We arrived we multiple large luggage’s and although there are multiple hotel personnel standing by the x-ray machine no one dares to help us unload our stuff. After they x-rayed our bags no one guided us where to go and they just stand there and busy themselves chitchatting. We carried all our bags to the elevator.  At the check-in reception: it was very disorganized and it looks like that most personnel don’t even know what to do. While\\Iza p\\Everything is just perfect! Staff- extremely Polite and accommodating, your comfort is their Top Priority. Room- very big, even bigger (wink) is the bathroom. I like the beds and the interior of the room. Tastefully designed. Breakfast buffet- OMG this is especially wonderful. Their Menu is extensive and everything is just delicious.\\Sanitv\\I stayed here for 4 nights during recent trip to Cebu. The hotel is located in the complex with restaurants and casino. However, the mall section still under construction.  Check In and check out progress is slow but helpful staff. The room is wide and fully equipped, espacially very comfortable mattress. The breakfast was also good with varieties of western and local food.\\Angelica T\\Manager Johanne Espinosa, Head Concierge Stephen Santiago and Vince of the concierge team went above and beyond to assist guests. Even though the hotel was quite new, they responded to every request timely and attentively with a smile. Exceeded expectations for sure!\\Christopher P\\As part of the organizing council of ABAC in Cebu. I was amazed as we arrived at Fili Hotel. The hotel is modern, clean,stylish and very luxurious from lobby to convention and rooms, it was extremely elegant and spacious.The food was great too. The hotel employees were very friendly. Although, I would say that there is room for improvement in terms of service. In particular, as we were preparing  in the Convention Hall B for the plenary meeting. I requested one male wait staff for chairs to be placed in the control booth, I waited for the chairs for about 20 minutes but the guy did not come back, so I went out to the lobby and was waiting for him impatiently as we needed the chairs but I could not find him, until one female wait staff named Lyn approached me and asked if she\\Oleg Mikhailov\\I visited Cebu for the ABAC and stayed here. Excellent Service from the hotel staff, upon arrival I was given a welcoming drink by a tall pretty lady named Lyn, what caught my attention is her warm and welcoming smile. The orange fizz was refreshing by the way. The room was very spacious, clean and had the amenities needed. Breakfast was delicious and with many choices. The people in the reception were very helpful in checkin and check out. Transaction was smooth. The convention were we held the meetings was very clean and staffs were very quick to replenish water, pencils and paper. Coffee and tea was good and Lyn was there too always smiling and helpful in giving directions to spots. She also recommended Fina restaurant and food was great. The location is great and near\\NewYorkWorldExplorer\\The hotel is part of the Nustar resort in the South Reclamation area which is a few minutes away from all the tourist spots and Cebu’s business district. The rooms are sparkling new and have beautiful views of the Mactan Bridge, the water, downtown, and the hills which all light up nicely at night. The bathrooms are luxurious and all amenities are provided. The most enjoyable part of our stay was the breakfast buffet at the Fili Cafe. Food was delicious and service was top notch. At the time of our visit, the mall, the sauna and spa, and certain areas of Nustar resort were still under construction or not yet operational. I expect it to be a popular destination when the entire Nustar resort is fully operational in 2024. Thumbs up!\\Stephanie C\\I am curious about the newest & famous 5 star hotel in Cebu City! As a family, we decided to dine in FILI cafe. The name itself is classy and inviting as well. So we decided to try just this month of Julu & I was surprised by the authenticity of the food! It was soooo delish and worth every penny! PLUS, the staff named DAN who accommodated is was very witty and his services to us was outstanding! He made us feel comfortable always and he was mindful everytime we need some assistance. Dan is highly commendable if only I have more time to commend him at that moment. He is one of the best servers I have ever met! Will definitely dine again at Fili and looking forward for Dan to assist us. Kudos to the entire staff for the great service. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\\Travel@buckets\\Good modern business hotel  New facilities  Booked a sea view room  Check in was uneventful  Staff are very attentive  Some facilities are still not open at the time  Pool side has great views but there’s no bar service -(  Room ample space for 2 adults  Beds pillows are very comfortable  Breakfast was great - multiple Asian and western selections  Tried Fili restaurant which is within the premises and the food is not only good but reasonably priced  Overall stay was satisfactory , close enough to explore the City so I would stay here again.\\Lynne Smith\\This is one of the newest hotels in Cebu City, so our family opted to visit this place. The property is still under construction especially the Nustar hotel.  This place was great and you have plenty of great restaurants from Michelin star to great Steakhouse you can choose from. Also, the staff were all nice and accommodating, special mention to Jane from the front desk and to the housekeeping team who maintains our room clean and tidy. One thing I noticed though is that we kept hearing noises outside our room at some point during our stay so I figured it was not really a sound proof one. The breakfast buffet was mouthwatering even though the varieties were kinda limited.

We are checking into NuStar Fil hotel right after we checked out from Sheraton Mactan resort for 3 days and 3 nights. The difference between Sheraton and NuStar is like day and night when it comes to service.   We arrived in NuStar via LG parking lot. We arrived we multiple large luggage’s and although there are multiple hotel personnel standing by the x-ray machine no one dares to help us unload our stuff. After they x-rayed our bags no one guided us where to go and they just stand there and busy themselves chitchatting. We carried all our bags to the elevator.  At the check-in reception: it was very disorganized and it looks like that most personnel don’t even know what to do. While\\Iza p\\Everything is just perfect! Staff- extremely Polite and accommodating, your comfort is their Top Priority. Room- very big, even bigger (wink) is the bathroom. I like the beds and the interior of the room. Tastefully designed. Breakfast buffet- OMG this is especially wonderful. Their Menu is extensive and everything is just delicious.\\Sanitv\\I stayed here for 4 nights during recent trip to Cebu. The hotel is located in the complex with restaurants and casino. However, the mall section still under construction.  Check In and check out progress is slow but helpful staff. The room is wide and fully equipped, espacially very comfortable mattress. The breakfast was also good with varieties of western and local food.\\Angelica T\\Manager Johanne Espinosa, Head Concierge Stephen Santiago and Vince of the concierge team went above and beyond to assist guests. Even though the hotel was quite new, they responded to every request timely and attentively with a smile. Exceeded expectations for sure!\\Christopher P\\As part of the organizing council of ABAC in Cebu. I was amazed as we arrived at Fili Hotel. The hotel is modern, clean,stylish and very luxurious from lobby to convention and rooms, it was extremely elegant and spacious.The food was great too. The hotel employees were very friendly. Although, I would say that there is room for improvement in terms of service. In particular, as we were preparing  in the Convention Hall B for the plenary meeting. I requested one male wait staff for chairs to be placed in the control booth, I waited for the chairs for about 20 minutes but the guy did not come back, so I went out to the lobby and was waiting for him impatiently as we needed the chairs but I could not find him, until one female wait staff named Lyn approached me and asked if she\\Oleg Mikhailov\\I visited Cebu for the ABAC and stayed here. Excellent Service from the hotel staff, upon arrival I was given a welcoming drink by a tall pretty lady named Lyn, what caught my attention is her warm and welcoming smile. The orange fizz was refreshing by the way. The room was very spacious, clean and had the amenities needed. Breakfast was delicious and with many choices. The people in the reception were very helpful in checkin and check out. Transaction was smooth. The convention were we held the meetings was very clean and staffs were very quick to replenish water, pencils and paper. Coffee and tea was good and Lyn was there too always smiling and helpful in giving directions to spots. She also recommended Fina restaurant and food was great. The location is great and near\\NewYorkWorldExplorer\\The hotel is part of the Nustar resort in the South Reclamation area which is a few minutes away from all the tourist spots and Cebu’s business district. The rooms are sparkling new and have beautiful views of the Mactan Bridge, the water, downtown, and the hills which all light up nicely at night. The bathrooms are luxurious and all amenities are provided. The most enjoyable part of our stay was the breakfast buffet at the Fili Cafe. Food was delicious and service was top notch. At the time of our visit, the mall, the sauna and spa, and certain areas of Nustar resort were still under construction or not yet operational. I expect it to be a popular destination when the entire Nustar resort is fully operational in 2024. Thumbs up!\\Stephanie C\\I am curious about the newest & famous 5 star hotel in Cebu City! As a family, we decided to dine in FILI cafe. The name itself is classy and inviting as well. So we decided to try just this month of Julu & I was surprised by the authenticity of the food! It was soooo delish and worth every penny! PLUS, the staff named DAN who accommodated is was very witty and his services to us was outstanding! He made us feel comfortable always and he was mindful everytime we need some assistance. Dan is highly commendable if only I have more time to commend him at that moment. He is one of the best servers I have ever met! Will definitely dine again at Fili and looking forward for Dan to assist us. Kudos to the entire staff for the great service. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\\Travel@buckets\\Good modern business hotel  New facilities  Booked a sea view room  Check in was uneventful  Staff are very attentive  Some facilities are still not open at the time  Pool side has great views but there’s no bar service -(  Room ample space for 2 adults  Beds pillows are very comfortable  Breakfast was great - multiple Asian and western selections  Tried Fili restaurant which is within the premises and the food is not only good but reasonably priced  Overall stay was satisfactory , close enough to explore the City so I would stay here again.\\Lynne Smith\\This is one of the newest hotels in Cebu City, so our family opted to visit this place. The property is still under construction especially the Nustar hotel.  This place was great and you have plenty of great restaurants from Michelin star to great Steakhouse you can choose from. Also, the staff were all nice and accommodating, special mention to Jane from the front desk and to the housekeeping team who maintains our room clean and tidy. One thing I noticed though is that we kept hearing noises outside our room at some point during our stay so I figured it was not really a sound proof one. The breakfast buffet was mouthwatering even though the varieties were kinda limited.

We are checking into NuStar Fil hotel right after we checked out from Sheraton Mactan resort for 3 days and 3 nights. The difference between Sheraton and NuStar is like day and night when it comes to service.   We arrived in NuStar via LG parking lot. We arrived we multiple large luggage’s and although there are multiple hotel personnel standing by the x-ray machine no one dares to help us unload our stuff. After they x-rayed our bags no one guided us where to go and they just stand there and busy themselves chitchatting. We carried all our bags to the elevator.  At the check-in reception: it was very disorganized and it looks like that most personnel don’t even know what to do. While\\Iza p\\Everything is just perfect!

The hotel is located in the complex with restaurants and casino. However, the mall section still under construction.  Check In and check out progress is slow but helpful staff. The room is wide and fully equipped, espacially very comfortable mattress. The breakfast was also good with varieties of western and local food.\\Angelica T\\Manager Johanne Espinosa, Head Concierge Stephen Santiago and Vince of the concierge team went above and beyond to assist guests.

The hotel is modern, clean,stylish and very luxurious from lobby to convention and rooms, it was extremely elegant and spacious.The food was great too. The hotel employees were very friendly. Although, I would say that there is room for improvement in terms of service. In particular, as we were preparing  in the Convention Hall B for the plenary meeting. I requested one male wait staff for chairs to be placed in the control booth, I waited for the chairs for about 20 minutes but the guy did not come back, so I went out to the lobby and was waiting for him impatiently as we needed the chairs but I could not find him, until one female wait staff named Lyn approached me and asked if she\\Oleg Mikhailov\\I visited Cebu for the ABAC and stayed here. Excellent Service from the hotel staff, upon arrival I was given a welcoming drink by a tall pretty lady named Lyn, what caught my attention is her warm and welcoming smile. The orange fizz was refreshing by the way. The room was very spacious, clean and had the amenities needed. Breakfast was delicious and with many choices. The people in the reception were very helpful in checkin and check out. Transaction was smooth. The convention were we held the meetings was very clean and staffs were very quick to replenish water, pencils and paper. Coffee and tea was good and Lyn was there too always smiling and helpful in giving directions to spots. She also recommended Fina restaurant and food was great. The location is great and near\\NewYorkWorldExplorer\\The hotel is part of the Nustar resort in the South Reclamation area which is a few minutes away from all the tourist spots and Cebu’s business district. The rooms are sparkling new and have beautiful views of the Mactan Bridge, the water, downtown, and the hills which all light up nicely at night. The bathrooms are luxurious and all amenities are provided. The most enjoyable part of our stay was the breakfast buffet at the Fili Cafe. Food was delicious and service was top notch. At the time of our visit, the mall, the sauna and spa, and certain areas of Nustar resort were still under construction or not yet operational. I expect it to be a popular destination when the entire Nustar resort is fully operational in 2024. Thumbs up!\\Stephanie C\\I am curious about the newest & famous 5 star hotel in Cebu City! As a family, we decided to dine in FILI cafe. The name itself is classy and inviting as well. So we decided to try just this month of Julu & I was surprised by the authenticity of the food! It was soooo delish and worth every penny! PLUS, the staff named DAN who accommodated is was very witty and his services to us was outstanding! He made us feel comfortable always and he was mindful everytime we need some assistance. Dan is highly commendable if only I have more time to commend him at that moment. He is one of the best servers I have ever met! Will definitely dine again at Fili and looking forward for Dan to assist us. Kudos to the entire staff for the great service. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\\Travel@buckets\\Good modern business hotel  New facilities  Booked a sea view room  Check in was uneventful  Staff are very attentive  Some facilities are still not open at the time  Pool side has great views but there’s no bar service -(  Room ample space for 2 adults  Beds pillows are very comfortable  Breakfast was great - multiple Asian and western selections  Tried Fili restaurant which is within the premises and the food is not only good but reasonably priced  Overall stay was satisfactory , close enough to explore the City so I would stay here again.\\Lynne Smith\\This is one of the newest hotels in Cebu City, so our family opted to visit this place. The property is still under construction especially the Nustar hotel.  This place was great and you have plenty of great restaurants from Michelin star to great Steakhouse you can choose from. Also, the staff were all nice and accommodating, special mention to Jane from the front desk and to the housekeeping team who maintains our room clean and tidy. One thing I noticed though is that we kept hearing noises outside our room at some point during our stay so I figured it was not really a sound proof one. The breakfast buffet was mouthwatering even though the varieties were kinda limited. Overall it was a great stay and definitely coming back.\\Tim W\\Coffee and frappes were great, blueberry muffin was soft and not too sweet. The ambiance is very luxurious and comfortable. Prices not too high despite the location and 5-star hotel location. Elvie was very accommodating and helpful.\\Xheelah M\\Very accommodating crew. The food is really authentic and delicious.

The people who take care of the place were incredibly accommodating, making the experience even more enjoyable.|Alyssa Magno|It was an experience to visit here as the meticulous restoration efforts have maintained its original structure, allowing visitors like me to step into the past and gain a deeper understanding of Cebu's history.

As you explore the exhibits and discover more about the things on show, a museum visit can be both informative and pleasant.

Our trip is definitely worthwhile.|Czanine J|I recently had a pleasure of visiting the Jesuit house during Gabii sa Kabilin 2023, and it was an absolute delight. The heritage house offers a fascinating glimpse into the city’s colonial past, providing us with a rich and immersive experience. There was also a live harp playing in the background which added to the nice vibe.|Rigil Kent Manatad|What impressed me most about the 1730 Jesuit House was its commitment to preserving history. The meticulous restoration work carried out on the house is evident in every detail, allowing visitors to truly appreciate the authenticity and charm of the original structure. It's a testament to the dedication and passion of the individuals involved in maintaining this cultural landmark. The interior of the Jesuit House is a treasure trove of artifacts and antiques. Each room showcases different aspects of Cebu's past, including religious relics, household items, and furniture from various periods. Walking through the rooms felt like stepping into a different era, with each item telling a unique story of the people who once inhabited the house.|SofiaB|The Jesuit House was an interesting visit. The house was able to preserve its vintage quality. We were able to learn about its history through the photos posted on its walls and the information given to us by the stationed guides. I also liked viewing the vintage items and artifacts that were on display. Lastly, I enjoyed listening to the harp performer present at the time.|Trisha Rebayla|The 1730 Jesuit House is certainly a hidden treasure within Parian. I noticed that the museum had areas which were still under construction. Despite that, the staff were quite welcoming with their sunny disposition and warm greetings as my friends and I entered the site. I would like to add that having free ice cream to end the museum tour was a brilliant idea! It was a humid night and it really helped cool us down.Although the whole concept of being a ""hidden treasure"" is great, I would recommend having 2-3 people from the staff accommodate guests from the outside (preferably where you could see traffic - the kind where there are people walking along the street) and not just from the registration area. My friends and I had difficulty finding the museum because of how mysterious it looked when in reality, we actually passed by the area at one point and did not even realize that it was a museum that was part of Gabii sa Kabilin 2023.I also suggest to improve the lighting from the outside because the street where the museum is located was quite dark which made my friends and I hesitant to go along that part of the road.Regardless, we have learned so much being inside the museum. It was like revisiting history all over again as we looked at the furniture, the infrastructure as a whole, and of course, the artifacts which were housed within the museum.Good luck on your future events! I hope to see you guys again the next time there'll be another GSK!|Nicole D|Although the museum have some parts under construction, the staffs are really accommodating and I can really now understand why is it called ""a secret museum"" because at first glance you won't know it's a museum because it is used as a hardware warehouse but inside lies an old house well maintained by the people who works there.|Reann G|Love the airconditioned place. Every relic found inside were amazing to see and I feel like it really shows an important part of what our history really looked like. Also, loved how they gave out free icecream after finishing the whole house [I think it was because of the GSK happening too] 🤘|Quevyn Adjutor Abuzo|As one of the oldest houses in Cebu/in the country, the place is a history lesson of Cebu... incarnate. Considering a coin was found buried in the house that dated back to the Ming Dynasty, one is surely left baffled on how an infrastructure older than their greatest, greater, great grandparents continues to stand on its ground.|Czar Emmanuel|Along with the nearby Yap-Sandiego ancestral house, this old Jesuit house, tucked inside a Chinese hardware, is considered as one of the oldest houses in the Philippines. An inscription inside the house dates its construction to the year 1730. Historical records say that it was formerly used as Jesuit house or one of its mission houses. Inside you'll be accompanied by a tour guide who will tell you about its history and guide you through its various rooms.|Xerxes R|Read about this place on trip advisor and am def happy we visted.

Even a nearby resident has admitted to be unaware of this. Not as “popular” other museums within the Parian District probably because of its unimpressive tarpaulin sign and it being “buried” in the midst of a hardware of its 3rd owner. Displays and galleries are well organized that its indeed a travel through time capsules.   Length of visit is dependent on whether one wants to read al the write ups.  Photography is allowed, unlike in museums in other parts of the country. It is actually the oldest recorded house in Cebu City, with the year of construction above the original main entrance.

For the ATM, there was a time when ALL of the ATM was not available and no directions posted in the machines as to where else we can find another ATM available. As a result, we have to go around asking other people for help. No computer mall directory. The same with toilets, I don't know why they don't have toilet paper for the comfort of their customers.

What set it apart was the tablet they will lend you (in my case I was reminded by the guard to get one since I'm halfway already when they noticed I don't have one) which serves as your personal tour guide which is played by one of the residents (reenactment) of the old house.vThe ground floor is air-conditioned and was okay. But going up the 2nd floor, you will get to experience what the early Cebuanos (the rich ones at least) experienced during their time. No Air-conditioning but lots of windows and ways to cool down. I really felt like I was taken back in time every room I enter while playing the appropriate voice and video caption per area of the house. The narration and stories really get me connected to the house as I take every step to every corner. Lastly, my enjoyable visit would not be possible if not for the kind and professional staffs, specially kuya Guard. Will definitely come back here withy family.|Meg Edelveiss D|Aside from the fact that the place was very aesthetic, the interior as well as the structure of this museum will make anyone awestruck.|Francis Demetri A|Casa Gorordo Museum in Cebu City is a captivating journey into the region's cultural heritage. The well-preserved colonial house, immersive exhibits, and knowledgeable staff create an exceptional experience. The museum offers a glimpse into the Gorordo family's life through authentic artifacts and personal belongings. It's a must-visit gem that showcases the rich history of the Philippines with passion and authenticity. The staff at Casa Gorordo Museum are incredibly passionate and well-informed. They are more than happy to answer any questions and share intriguing anecdotes about the house and its history. Their dedication to preserving and promoting local heritage is commendable and adds a layer of authenticity to the overall experience.|Vinabel Felisilda|One of the living historical sites that maintain Cebu's rich history, culture, and tradition is the Casa Gorordo Museum. The two-story house's construction with stone blocks, hardwood flooring, and treasures inside greatly astounded me. Every time I see those beautiful pieces on exhibit, it takes me on a fascinating voyage through time. With that, I can say, it is truly an art!|Meg Edelveiss D|The place spoke volumes of Cebu's heritage and it was nostalgic roaming all over the place. The staff were also very accommodating and there were also some amazing performances of arnis and some Philippine dances as well.|Agnes G|Entering the building felt like we time travelled to hundreds of years ago. The building design wasn't the only thing that was old-fashioned, but also the furniture inside. Equipment used by the country during the old times were displayed, and it was very fascinating to see.|Stella B|Casa Gorordo is a museum located at the heart of Cebu City. We visited the museum during our Gabii sa Kabilin event. There were a lot of people in the museum and yet, the staff handled the crowd professionally as there were lines and a clear area on where to enter and exit the museum. The museum was full of wonderful artifacts, from history to religion, and we really had a great time there. The balcony of the museum feels like we’re living in the past, just like the women in the past waiting for their lovers to make harana. There was also a Bo’s coffee where people could sit and have a good time after visiting. Balik batik was also there and we got to try on filipinianas and take great pictures. All in all, it is indeed a must visit when touring in Cebu City.|Hans Y|To experience going to a museum in casa corordo made feel like going back to the past and learning more about them.|Kiar|The place was beautiful and interesting. I haven't really gone to musuems in Cebu, so this was a great first stop. The artifacts were well preserved and I particularly liked the different dishware and cooking pots. My only problem was the place was really really crowded, but this was more so our problem than the museums. Once we stepped out on to the garden however, the air felt great and the food stalls were tasty. Would definitely go here again.|Sydney G|We weren't able to completely appreciate and explore the museum because there were so many people, but despite the limited time, we were equally as impressed with the artworks. One of the must-see displays was a glow-in-the-dark artwork. In addition, the museum itself was a work of art. The museum's architecture and design could transport you to another period!|Alexis T|Upon entering the museum, I was immediately struck by the sense of history that enveloped the space. The well-preserved architecture, ornate furniture, and meticulous attention to detail created an authentic atmosphere that effortlessly transported me to a bygone era. The knowledgeable and passionate staff members were eager to share the stories behind each item, further enriching my understanding of the family's lineage and the significance of the artifacts on display. The museum's commitment to authenticity and preservation was evident throughout. The family's personal belongings, photographs, and letters were carefully curated, providing a personal connection to the past. It was truly remarkable to witness how the museum seamlessly blended historical significance with intimate family stories, creating a profound sense of connection and empathy with the people who once called this house their home.|Faith S|The house was perfectly preserve, leading us into being more intruiged compared to the other exhibitions. So much history, as well as mystery lies within each step along with the fascinating introduction of Filipino culture reflected through the statues located at the first floor. The paintings and in inheritance, even with the simpliest notebook, showed presence of life and privilege in the past. Not to mention the cafe at the end of the tour being a perfect cherry on top as it helped us rest and encapsulate the beauty of such Casa.|Nev Leanne Apolonio|My experience at Casa Gorordo during the Gabii sa Kabilin event in Cebu was truly unforgettable. The historic ambiance of Casa Gorordo perfectly complemented the evening's cultural festivities. The interactive exhibits and guided tours provided fascinating insights into the rich heritage and traditions of Cebu. The tour transported me back in time and left me with a deep appreciation for Cebuano culture. Overall, Gabii sa Kabilin at Casa Gorordo was a captivating and enlightening experience that I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Cebu.|Glide Deniere|Me and my groupmates had a lot of fun during our visit to the museum last May 12, 2023. Being there gave us an amazing experience and more knowledge about history.|Alyssa Magno|I loved how Casa Gorordo was beautifully preserved and still felt like a home rather than a museum. It was such a great experience to visit here and have a glimpse of what the past was like.|Czanine J|A trip to the past where our current culture is diverse and came from our previous ancestors. The classical designs is way of making us look back to our past culture and way of living.|Elthea Vinnah|The house is very nice because of its architectural beauty.

As soon as I arrived, I was immediately struck by the peaceful atmosphere and the stunning architecture.The prayer halls were serene, and I found myself taking a moment to reflect and connect with my spirituality. Lighting incense and making wishes felt incredibly meaningful and personal.|YuppieLionheart|Free entrance with allotted parking space for visitors. You just have to make sure that your knees are prepared for their stairs, one of the visitors I saw as an elderly and they did not proceed because it's too high and they got tired in the middle so they let their young adults go to the temple on their own. I can say that it's worth it once you reach the top, you'll see a beautiful view and the architecture is really admiring but also please respect the rules as it's a place of worship. There's also an assigned police in the area when we went there.|Simon C|This is worth a visit and a climb – its surprisingly steep. Its an impressive building and series of praying areas. Tourists are encouraged to visit but there is very little information about the temple or the religion, the only interaction is with the somewhat authorisation temple helpers holding up signs to ask you to wear a face mask (really?  - and its outdoors when its not legal requirement).   I would have welcomed an explanation of the “kidney beans”, which provides a yes, no, maybe answer to a question you pose, but at first sight, it does seem to be merely an example of probability theory rather than evidence of a higher being.|Chi_Tiff|While I enjoyed my visit, you can see the entire thing in about ten minutes. I wasn’t allowed in the temple itself because I was wearing shorts and my shoulda were exposed, so if you want to enter this is something to be mindful of. It was alright but there are definitely better things to see/spend your money and time on.|DrNBA|This view of Beverly Hills in Cebu is breathtaking! Very nice and clean, quite space to meditate as well.|loo c|Taoist Temple is a popular attraction located in Cebu City, Philippines.

The temple is ornately decorated with traditional Chinese designs, intricate carvings, and colorful paintings.One of the most significant features of the temple is the ""Wishing Well,"" where visitors can toss two stones into the well while making a wish. If the stones land inside the circle, it is believed that their wishes will come true.Another important attraction is the Dragon's Head and Dragon's Tail, which is said to bring good luck and fortune to visitors who touch them.
