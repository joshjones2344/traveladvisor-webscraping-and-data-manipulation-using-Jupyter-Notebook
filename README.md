# TripAdvisor Data Extraction and Manipulation Project
## Overview
This project focuses on extracting and manipulating data from the TripAdvisor website using Jupyter Notebook. TripAdvisor is a popular platform for travel reviews, ratings, and recommendations, making it a valuable source for analyzing user opinions about various destinations, hotels, and attractions.

## Project Goals
1. **Data Extraction**: Utilize web scraping techniques to extract relevant data from TripAdvisor, including reviews, ratings, and other essential information.

2. **Data Manipulation**: Clean and preprocess the extracted data to make it suitable for analysis. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and structuring the data for exploration.

## Tools and Technologies Used
> **Jupyter Notebook**: The primary platform for coding and documentation.
> **Python**: The programming language used for web scraping, data manipulation, and analysis.
> **Beautiful Soup and Requests**: Python libraries for web scraping.
> **Pandas**: Data manipulation library for cleaning and structuring the data.
## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

> **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with the step-by-step code and analysis.
> **Data**: Stores the extracted data and any intermediate datasets.
> **Scripts**: Additional Python scripts for specific tasks (if applicable).

## Note: For Study Purposes Only(web scrape script not upload due to TripAdvisor Policy)
This project is intended for study purposes only. The goal is to demonstrate web scraping, data extraction, and manipulation techniques. It should not be used for commercial purposes, and any data obtained should comply with TripAdvisor's terms of service.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights into user sentiments and preferences on TripAdvisor. By combining web scraping and data manipulation, we can uncover patterns and trends that can be beneficial for businesses in the travel and hospitality industry. Feel free to explore the notebooks and adapt the code for your specific use case.
