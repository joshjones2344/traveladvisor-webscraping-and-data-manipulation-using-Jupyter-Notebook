Bayfront Hotel Cebu - North Reclamation,"Bob B//The bed sheets were filthy with excrement on them!  My fiancee and I booked this hotel, when we went to get into the bed, I noticed brown stains on the sheet, which was excrement. The manager came and said the sheets and room were cleaned. She basically accused me of dirtying the sheets. I then actually dropped my shorts and bent over and said look at my back side and you will see its clean. We immediately packed and left the hotel for a budget hotel. At no stage did the manager attempt to find us another room! Will never go to this hotel again!//OceanLovingCouple//Mostly good experiences with well maintained rooms, good wifi etc.  We chose it as is close to Pier to get waterjet to Bohol and half the price of Radission Blu just down the road a bit further.  Cons are noise and crowds.  There are vehicles blaring airhorns in the middle of the night and the siren from the port every couple hours. The crowds at breakfast are daunting. Checkin and checkout chaotic crowding in lobby.  Only two elevators so often must wait and will be packed in like sardines.//dabawenyo//I have stayed here for 3 nights. It is a brand new budget hotel in Cebu City, perfectly well located next to SM City, ports going to nearby islands and provinces, a bus terminal going to places with beautiful tourists attraction particularly Bantayan Island. A very busy hotel, rates include buffet breakfast. The daily breakfast is always packed. It is 2 mins walk to SM but the 7/11 convenience store at the lobby is definitely a plus factor. I am staying here again in August 2023 before flying to our final destination for our family holiday in the Philippines!//Edwin R//This hotel was good for the area. It‚Äôs always hot and muggy so a nice cool room is always good. Spacious and welcoming. The staff was great. Lots to do in the area walking or riding. Have to look for the nite life.//Sandy_Star2012//Booked this hotel last minute as a ""stop-over"".    Pros: The front desk staff were very professional. The room was ready and clean and had all the amenities needed, including hair dryer and slippers. They also have a clothes line in the bathroom where you can hang wet swimwear etc. Bed was comfortable and we had a good night's rest. It can be noisy at dawn due to the bus station just across the street.  There's a restaurant, ATM, 7-11 at the ground floor and a gym at the 6th floor.  Cons - it can get chaotic during breakfast. I saw some guests not having a place to sit. In my view, the staff should seat the guests and also have tables for 2 to maximize the space.//Run around traveller//The hotel it self are fine for a 3 star. Superior Room spacious enough with good shower pressure. Can be noisy due to group checking and talking loudly in the room corridor.   The location apart of close to the main shopping mall, nothing else surrounding there. The hotel location are not close to airport.   Breakfast time are crazy busy due to many groups traveller, my first day breakfast have over 80 to 100 schools teenagers fit into the small size restaurant. Food is below average.//Liau Yuan Wei//We stayed one night there as we returned from Bohol, before we flew off back him the next day. Location: Very close to the airport (30mins ride) and also directly opposite of SM Cebu, one of the largest malls in Cebu City.  Amenities: When we entered our room, we saw a big wardrobe with hangers and a safe to the right of us. However the safe couldn‚Äôt be used as it was permanently locked. To the left was the toilet which was pretty well equipped I would say. We each had a set of toothpaste, toothbrush and cup. An interesting thing was there was a thin string as a clothing line inside the shower cubicle. There was also an anti-slip mat too. Note that there‚Äôs no bathtub. The bedroom had 2 double decker beds that look like army bunks üò≥ The sheets weren‚Äôt totally clean as I spotted//Kasumi R//Overall: 4/5 We stayed for 4 nights in the Barkada Room   To breakdown my review: 1. Facility - 4/5 - The place is clean and spacious for the 4 of us. There is hot water available for the shower. There is a bidet in the toilet. Cons for me is that there is no swimming pool in the hotel and bath tub. (though I already knew of this before booking). Also, do not book the barkada room if you have children or elderly. The upper bunk is hard to climb and each movement of the person on top/bottom shakes the whole bed.  2. Service - 5/5 - The staff are kind. Water bottles are provided daily in your room as part of the accommodations. Towels are also changed daily unless you don't want to.   3. Food - 4/5 - Breakfast in hotel is buffet. Consists of Filipino food: Tocino, Corned Beef,//Mike Finn-St. James//This was the second time that we stayed at this hotel and twice we were disappointed with the rooms given even when we had booked our superior rooms months in advance and paid online. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that our room was not available AGAIN and then was told there is only a room with bunk beds?? (Honestly unbelievable it‚Äôs not a hostel) I don‚Äôt see any point in booking any room at this hotel, it seems it‚Äôs first come first served ( Not a way a hotel should be managed). Also the woman receptionist needs more training on how to welcome guests and not look sour faced as if we are not welcome.  Another note too!! If you not up for breakfast at 6 in the morning there will not be a lot left!!//Adrian B//Caja Kitchen - Sir Khennith No Courtesy, asked for help but just instructed me to go to the entrance counter and left. Lack of desire to help and info missing. He's even using his phone while working, watching NBA updates.    Front Desk - Mr. Lindayao I started a small talk, he did not indulge/engage himself; knowing full well that it wasn't even a peak hour for checking in or check out (time check: 4:40ish). He's the same person I talked to over the phone asking if there's a bigger size for the complimentary slippers, but just said that there's none, (monotone) wasn't even bothered to maybe at least explain why there wasn't any available (though I get it since mostly stick to standard filipino size). Also, I felt being profiled by the bellboy (maybe because we came in just by//Johan Munoz//Overall experience is great!  From the front Desk to the Operation Manager are all excellent in doing customer service..  KUDOS to the team for making my stay very comfortable.  I just need to call out the attention of the resto management on their staff who received my call for room service.. she needs improvement in dealing with guest.. bit rude and unapproachable.. talking to her about my OR ( ordered food ) she just shut me off by saying.. "" Di kami nag iisue nyan dito"" - explained to her that yesterday i already had signed some OR.. instead of assisting .. she just told me."" Tanunigin ko na lang sa front desk""  -  very disappointing!    But it was a relief talking to the Operation Manager absorbing all issues and giving me assurance..   still will consider staying here in//Ian//I was so grateful that the hotel extended the lent staycation promo for me.  I stayed there for 2 nights and 3 days. The room was great - so comfy and complete.  I just bothered with the other guests' children who are roaming around and a bit noisy. I am hoping that the staff will properly orient the quests, especially with kids to avoid running, roaming, and making some noise in the hallways.   For the hallways on the 12th floor, since I stayed in a corner-end room, I observed that the floor was not that well-cleaned. And as for the free breakfast, kulang. Good thing there's 7/11 with the hotel's vicinity, I was able to buy food.   Overall, I had a comfy staycation there. Thank you.//@Mikeselaeleventwo//Check in was fast, less than 5 minutes. You'll be provided a complimentary alcohol upon arrival. No queue at all. There are hand sanitizing stations every high touch point/area. Telephone operators are also friendly. Tess stands out with a very accommodating approach and tone of voice. Well done for the manager in charge in front office department. The staffs execute their job efficiently. Therefore, they were guided properly. In addition, breakfast selection is also great! There are food barriers and only the F&B staffs are allowed to distribute the food spread. Good ideaüëç. All in all, we felt comfortable staying at Bayfront despite of the pandemic.  Thank you Bayfront team! ‚ô•Ô∏è Room 609 / March 11-17, 21//BigEarTours//I had a great stay at Bayfront Hotel, Cebu.   The location is very convenient wherein it is about 30 minutes away from the airport, and right across the hotel is the MyBus terminal where this bus is also a convenient transportation service going to and from the airport.   The hotel also has 711 store and ATMS which are very convenient, but if you like to go on a heavy shopping, one of the biggest malls in Cebu is just a minute walk away from the hotel.   The food was delectable and it satisfied my cravings. I recommend their Salisbury steak and their Chicken Cordon Bleu. If you will be having the dinner buffet,  ask them if they have the Bistek Tagalog, which is really good.  Their staff is very accommodating. They always follow the safety protocols, even my dining experience//Emme_Cee_85//Please orient your security guards to be courteous of guests - after all, they are the first ones guests meet. It was my first time to stay and I was unfamiliar with the hotel that i took the wrong entry point going to the hotel. The guard was RUDE and OBNOXIOUS and did not even bother to guide me towards the correct entry point. I had to honk at him loud and tell him help me get out of the exit.  Checking out was also slow.//Car0lyn1022//I love the location of this hotel, which is just across the bus station and a big mall. The facilities are good, and there's also an ATM and 711 store beside it. However, service needs to be improved. They disturbed my sleep by calling me very early in the morning just to ask what breakfast I want? This is truly disappointing for a late sleeper like me! They could have asked during check-in or the night before. Also, I ask to borrow an iron but have to call them again to follow-up and got it after an hour of requesting it! I dont find the front desk staff friendly. She shouted at me to wear my mask in front of many people at the lobby. The only good service I got is they agreed when i ask for a late checkout, which is at 1pm. I really hope they will improve the service because i//Guido//Nice rooms, competent reception staff, frendly. Bad restaurant needs new manager and cook, food is horrible.A good reataurant would help boost occupancies in time of Covide19. I dont want to return as long....//BibiX//I did enjoy my stay in Bayfront Hotel Cebu. Edmerick/Edmer the front office desk, he‚Äôs the best! I felt his connection with his guests the way he accommodates us, you will feel that you‚Äôre truly welcome in Bayfront Hotel.   Also, Loren or Loraine and Austin did a respectable job in assisting their guests. In my experience, it was one of the best hotel stays in Cebu.   Regardless of the small hotel issues I have, the management still handled my concerns well. I highly recommend it!//Mamer N//i love the location , its across sm city cebu you can walk to it. the room is spacious , upkeep is not the best though, it feels like a bit rundown already considering its quite a new hotel. buffet was good and the hotel staff were friendly and accommodating. i love the fact they have in house spa, we had room service massage three times during our stay.//David W//Stayed for the 6th time in 2Y in this hotel. Price vs quality correct,  old rooms with smelly carpets but spacious and big bathroom with a bathtub. You need to unplug the night light to connect your phone charger to a plug. But the hotel has an outstanding security and an outstanding breakfast buffet. Checkin and checkout is super slow but all staff is super friendly and well trained.  Yes, a hotel with contradictions but I return to this wonderful hotel each time I come to Cebu."
