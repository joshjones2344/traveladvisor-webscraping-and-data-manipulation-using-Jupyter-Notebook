Bluewater Maribago Beach Resort,"Maia Celeste A//It took sooooo long for our rooms to get ready. We booked early, they asked for 50% downpayment (which other resorts don‚Äôt require) and still made us wait for more than an hour for our rooms to be available. I do not recommend this if you want comfort and efficiency.//ÏòàÎπà ÍπÄ//Amazing Bluewater Resort. All of the staff were sooo kind and freindly. There are very nice swimming pool and nice view. I‚Äôll recommend here to my friends! Thankyou so much. I love Cebu. I love Bluewater Resort!//joeCworld//Overpriced resort for what you are getting for. The ‚Äúprivate‚Äù beach was littered with plastics and garbage in and out of the water. The pool water was murky. The bathroom would always emit a strong sewage smell. It‚Äôs a happening resort , so it‚Äôs always loud and noisy. Definitely not a place to stay if you want that beach peace & quiet time.We booked 5 nights but left after our 4th night (they did not refund that last night btw).  Although, I would commend the staff running the Allegro dining and the front desk. They were professional and very friendly. I paid for both service and the stay as well, not just the service. Reiterating that this was not a cheap hotel. We paid $1,200+ for the  5 nights and that only includes breakfast. Food in the resort is overpriced as well. They//Carina P//Maribago Bluewater resorts is the best beaches in lapu2 which I really like the most, because of their hospitable employees/workers, the food, the facilities and the very accommodating personnale.. If we had a better/longer days to stay, I ruther choose Bluewater..//Ivan Anthony C//We had our company teambuilding event here last June and we had a few mishaps. There were a lot of meetings beforehand to make sure that everything is ironed out. Logistic-wise, here's our experience: - Group check-in was late. The last group was checked-in at almost 5 pm. We had an early morning flight so this caused discomfort for most participants. We have an event at dinner time so people had no time to rest. - Food was hit or miss.//Hertz A//One thing that I always check every time I go to a spa is cleanliness. Let me tell you, theirs is superb. And nothing beats the smell of a clean sheet while you lie and relax. Definitely the best massage and sauna experience by far!//Sonia C//Staffs are very friendly and entertaining guest very well. Food are good. Different kind of tea bag is great. Any problems/concerns resolved right away. We love landscape, restaurant and beaches are very convenient. It's great and wonderful. I recommend this BLUEWATER RESORT to all tourists come in Philippines. Thank you.//abe a//Ambience: Not as restful and relaxing as expected. The rooms are big but not insulated? I keep waking up to the sound of people at the pool outside and the resort staff chatting by the lifeguard station. At night when the pool is quiet, i wake up to the sound of a cat.  The beach itself isn't ideal for swimming. Seemed like a mangrove area.  There was a LOT of food for our event and for the , but sadly there fell way short of expectation. There was a lot of flies on the night buffet we had at the sandbar. We were there for a weekend and it was the one time they served the famous Cebu lechon but I couldn't even try with all the giant flies.  Service: Our flight was already delayed but when we arrived we sat at the function hall waiting for a room to open up so we could check in.//Dream157783//Since 2010 we are regular guests from Europe and 1 or 2 times a year, 2-3 weeks each, in BLUEWATER MARIBAGO BEACH RESORT. Till 2020, before pandemic, we are as more as more as pleased and felt there always very well. But this year, 2023, it changed completely, we were really disappointed. The breakfast buffet has been changed, some small doesn't longer offered e. g. yoghurt or french toast. But ok, we understand it. Each 2nd day it exists an event at the beach area, often as more as one. On weeksends (Sa to Su) often up to 5 events and it is impossible to enjoy the beach area for the guests. In one night from Fr to Sa you built again one more tent for one more event at the beach and it ends after 3 am. It was noisy and we couldn't fall in a sleep. On the next morning we talked//Lala258//Resort price and staff service were very good! They do first come first serve basis. The only concern was the beach area, rubbish leftover from fathers day guest was left overnight in the beach and was cleaned up in the  following morning by the tide. Spoke to one guard roaming around and his saying they do the cleaning. Somehow i never argue about it. What i have seen hoping will never be seen again by another guest. Anyway i do hope they will improve the cleanliness in the beach area as they have a beautiful beach. Only a bit muddy under the water where its the type of area they are in and thats nothing we can do about that. Enjoyed our time inspite of all that as staff are all accommodating and so friendly.  Spa staff, concierge, reception, waiters and waitresses, room//Romeo R//Useless ...if got a tv but cannot use.... according to them,no signal....not recommended to eat at the restaurant,eat outside restaurant or mall....much cheaper....up to individual...and their restaurant got a lot of house fly...//VGV//We stayed last June 11, at room 110 and 111. Shout out to front peeps Cortney and Jay who were professional and very helpful during check-in, although they were busy, but they made sure that our rooms became available since we had a senior citizen with us. Big thank you. And with Ian of restaurant, he's very attentive to our needs. By the way, the food is great!//Ai//Everyone was very kind and accommodating, any concerns were quickly resolved. As a person with severe food allergies they were very thorough in making sure my food was safe for me to eat and made me feel at ease. Food was delicious! The pools are well cleaned, the beach was intimate and serene.

Many ramps and railings available. many facilities within the resort, tasty food, access to the private beach, child and family friendly.//Peter A//Beautiful place. Short ride to the shops Food was delicious  No issues with the rooms.

Five stars//Ayn//The rooms were clean, very comfortable and spacious. Very comfortable bed. Food was superb. Had our buffet lunch and breakfast there. Everthing is perfectly cooked to our liking. The staff was amazing. Special mention to Ariel Caintic. He went over and beyond to help make our stay enjoyable. I highly recommend this resort/hotel for anyone visiting Cebu.//rossettig//Family event -  From the get go at arrival to departure  front desk service was pitiful and awful experience. Booked two rooms with breakfast and dinner included.  No TV service and no WiFi in room. Was given a run around from front desk multiple times and multiple techs that could not resolve problem. Demand to speak to a managed and was told was on day off. ( Friday check in)- ugh) -  That‚Äôs okay I will be here tomorrow as well.  Manager did greet me same day and did change our two rooms. Guess what ? no TV in one room and no WiFi  linked to room number. Run around again. WiFi connection not granted for 24 hours after signing in to visitors WiFi . Ugh again - can‚Äôt explain stupid - No pool towels cards given at check in and run around again when needing a pool towel.  Was not//JUNG JUHYUN J//This is my second visit  Last time I was in the premiere room  This time, both of us are satisfied with the Amuma room. However, I wish they had done more to manage the swimming pool on the Auma side. Still friendly staff clean environment  I would like to visit again.//darren p//Stayed at the resort for 3 nights from 29th March to 1st April and had a nice time at the resort. The rooms were fine, nothing outstanding but they were very clean and comfortable. Food was great and the staff were fantastic, very friendly and helpful. The resort is old now and its showing but my stay was enjoyable and I would recommend it.//Youmin K//I took a massage course of ‚ÄúAmuma signature healer‚Äù today by Rose. She was awesome I can really being relaxed with this good experience. And I had a cramp in my left leg so also took a massage of ‚ÄúFood massage‚Äù. It was also nice because I could take this service in front of the swimming pool with birds singing. I highly recommend it to all travelers who will visit here.//Sightsee13695926049//ONE OF THE BEST OF THE BEST EXPERIENCES I HAD.

To the food and beverage staff for being helpful. Many thanks a lot for them//eartha d//When I went with my bestfriend to dine at BLUEWATER MARIBAGO, we tried their breakfast buffet which the price is very good considering numerous option and the great quality of food. Eggs were tasty, fluffy and not oily by Chef Daneth at the egg station. And the ""donuts"" by SSI Chef Nino were exceptional! In fact I ask them if they sell the donuts so I could buy and bring it home for my son and husband to enjoy. Thank you BLUEWATER MARIBAGO for my delicious breakfast and to the staff that were very warm and freindly.//maria frances d//Always a good staycation everytime we come. Courteous staff, greets you wherever they meet youand service is always g√≤od.  Place is clean and well kept. Food is great. Nice beach and pools.Had a restful stay. Best to  be a member to enjoy more perks!  Very satisfied member hereüëå.//Discover628530//the  picture of the little island opposite of the bay doesnt resemble ANYTHING on the pictures. we walked across the bay to check it out, only to walk thru the water where there was rusty tin cans and metal bars on the ground. wehen we got to the island the dirty chairs were stacked, no lounges, no bar, no nice flags, no staff, NOTHING!!! On the way back one of us stepped on sea urchins. Got 15 spikes! There was no caution information that we were endangered in any way. The experience was very disappointing, leading to us leaving to go somewhere else to enjoy the ocean. The food, rooms, pools and staff were all fine, pleasant and helpful.//Dennis P//Its my second time visiting this resort. It seems nothing has change since 10yrs ago. And i think its time to do for some upgrades. but still it is beautiful, clean, well maintained, friendly staff and  affordable. Not bad for a 4 star rated resort.//Debbie G//Amuma spa was VERY NICE. Highly recommended!   Rooms were big and spacious!   With 3 pools, we had a lot of options. The beach had white sands and fishes- thoroughly enjoyed by our kids-6yo and 7yo.   Food was very delicious. Breakfast buffet offered international fare with Filipino/Cebuano influence incorporated in pastries. Loved the bibingka- filipino coconut cake.  Service is very exceptional!//Jules B//Great resort with lots of options to relax. Breakfast buffet is superb and should not be missed.  Happy hour at the Oyster Bar is a fantastic place to unwind and get ready for an evening meal. The staff are wonderful and welcoming. Would come back again."
