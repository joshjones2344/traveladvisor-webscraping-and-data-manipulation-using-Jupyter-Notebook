Cebu White Sands Resort & Spa,"dragster180\\Went to cebu on a business trip so i checked in here, staffs are friendly, facilities are great, come with a free buffet breakfast and it is good.   The pool is big and clean, the beach is clean and no waves when i went there,  water sports and tours are available like island hoping and others.   Lots of korean visitors though hehe.\\Paw Jacob S\\Back in 2013 we are in her for the first time and have the time of our life. So when we come back to cebu we had to come back.. Is so an amazing place. Sweet people and nice room. And the most professional spa.\\dragster180\\I arrived a little early before the standard checkin time of 2pm, but Ann and her manager i think at her back was very very helpfull to accomodate me and gave me a room with a view wow! Staffs are very helpful and always greeting me and cheerful.   I will go back here with my family next, i stayed here on business so i didnt had the time to relax since this is a working visit, beach and facilities are superb. The bar the restaurant the lobby are superb! Parking spaces the entrance to the hotel is really good!   Planning to go back here on May maybe after our trip to Japan next month.   Highly recommend here to stay and relax!   Again miss Ann daghan salamat.\\Al V\\A great accommodation which is beach front albeit small portion of it and has its own pool. The room was surprisingly big including the bathroom which was huge and had its own bath tub. Breakfast buffet with ample choices. Reliable Wi-Fi and excellent hotel staff. I liked their rooftop bar which has excellent views of Mactan and Cebu City and has a live performer\\Jsej\\It's a nice hotel but so many bugs in the ocean Hard to walk at the beach. People always ask you island hoping. They are too OA about foreigners!!!I just like out waitress Lea she's so nice. She took care of us since our day one until our last night in the hotel.\\Frank L\\We stayed 2 nights at White Sands Resort . My impressions were very positive with no complaints. Attentive staff and good facilities.  Pros:  Very good buffet breakfast. Excellent clean rooms with good Sky cable TV. Very good surroundings .  Cons:  Do not pay extra for a dinner option . There is no buffet  in the evening  and the only dinner option is to choose a mediocre  plate  only with no option starter or desert The plate is either meat or fish ,rice and a kind of pickled ""orange""  despite there being different vegetable combination on the card. Very poor value  for money,\\Johnny R\\We ate at White Sands more than 35 times last year....we just ate there today and were shocked by the amount we were charged for a small can of soda...  120 pesos...we will not return until they charge fairly on their drinks...so sad...so disappointed.\\Wolfgagging\\I think this place is trying to save money and milk every penny they can out of there customers. So yes I no there was a typhoon in December but 2 months later they not advertise what the hotel facilities are available. So no tv in the room no internet in room and lucky if you find it any where in the resort.  When we checked in there was dirty plates with left over food on in the corridor was there a day later. I asked for house keeping they say government rules cannot clean until we been there 3 days now all the other hotels we stay at do not have these rules As for the swimming pool that had no water in it so how can you use that and the hotel roof top bar that is also closed so mainly you have a room in a over priced resort with no facilities  Food and drinks are so\\Dennis P\\I want to laud the management of cebu whitesands resorts for opening up immediately after the typhoon even though they suffered heavily. Its a big relief for guests like us who were looking for some place to relax our mind and de stress due to the typhoon. Good job and thank you cebu whitesands management and the whole team.\\mpmadz\\Had bad asthma and allergy attack during my stay as the ac was mouldy, filthy with black dusts so imagine breathing this air in an enclosed space. The rooms smell of either pipes or uncleaned ac. They moved us to another room which was a bit better but was still smelly.   The hot water is not hot for tub so if you want to relax in a tub youre gonna have to soak in room temp to cold water. The bed was hard and I had bad hip and back pain from the bed. I got sick during my stay. Not staying again. I usually dont write reviews or give negative comments but the basics of relaxing stay is just not there. If you want to snorel youre gonna have to go far off. The rooms are dated.   The place is quiet and green. It feels private. And the toiletries are nice. But wont be staying again.\\ItsmeKarla27\\We stay 4 nights from Mar.2-6,2018. Is it really 4star hotel in Philippines? Did you inspect your toilets in heritage wing.There is some rust and need badly complete renovation for the toilet. Beach with full of ships/bangka. There's a small place to swim in sea. Swimming pool are both good. They accept daytour for swimming. Koi ponds are beautiful. The visitors are not allowed to enter the room,if they wanted to stay in room..should pay 1800 pesos. I understand the rules but it's not really about security measures. It's about business. I already visit 4times Shangrila,but never issues about relatives/visitors entering our room. Visitor's are not welcome this hotel. The visitors are allowed in lobby or restaurant. It's about business. As a filipina wife with many relatives. We\\Brad P\\Watch Out!  Spent two nights here with family while on a longer trip to Manila.  I will start out by saying prior to us checking out we all agreed that on our next trip to Cebu we should return, however our checkout experience soured this hotel to us and we will NOT be back!  We all stayed in the heritage (older) rooms and were pleasantly surprised with the size of the rooms and the spacious bathrooms.  Although some of the soft items (towels) were well worn and were in desperate need of replacing the beds were heavenly!  It was such a relief to have such a soft and comfortable bed to sleep on!  The bathroom in our room was huge!  The most important thing, the A/C worked wonderfully!  The hotel is very close to a SM grocery store to stock up on snacks and other needed items\\JAEHHYUK\\화이트 샌즈 리조트의 신관 건물인 mabuhay wing 에만 존재하는 프리미어 룸 입니다.  프리미어 룸은 구관 건물인 헤리티지 윙 이나 코트야드 윙 건물에는 없어요. 그래서 디럭스 룸이나 그랜드럭스 룸과 다르게 100% 확율로 신관 마부하이 윙 건물로 배정받을수 있습니다.  사진은 야간에 체크인 직후의 사진 입니다. 퀸 사이즈 침대 2개가 세팅 되어 있습니다. 깔끔한 타일 바닥과 샤워실 겸 화장실, 그리고 발코니 가 있습니다.  샤워 부스의 배수가 천천히 물이 빠지는 부분이 아쉬운 부분 이지만 4스타 급 리조트 와5스타 급 리조트를 동일하게 비교하는것은 무리겠지요.   발코니에는 수영복이나 다이버 슈트 ㄷㅇ을 말릴수 있도록 조치가 되어있고요.  가격 대비 무난하고 만족했던 리조트 및 룸 컨디션 입니다.   룸은 304호 였습니다.   This is a Premier Room only locate in Mabuhay Wing, the new building of White Sands Resort.  The Premier Room is not in the Heritage Wing or Cortland Wind Building, which is an antique building. So, unlike deluxe rooms or grand lux rooms can be assigned to the new building, MabuhaI wing with a 100 % magnification.  Pictures are taken right after check-in at night time.\\lucyparra9\\We stayed here for just one night during a long layover. Would not book it again. Theres only wifi in the main lobby area, the rooms are dirty and humid, a/c barely worked and the shower was real dirty. I guess we got what we paid for.\\Julia K\\Stayed here for a few days in February. We initially booked this hotel because of the reasonable price. The hotel was just ok...  Pros: -the pool was a nice size and great sun -breakfast was a wide variety, had breakfast and lunch foods included -great sun all day -room was nice size and fit 3 people -people were pretty friendly -did the discovery tour which was so fun, great food and views and hotel representative was great too. Would definitely recommend it!  Cons: -old ish hotel  -they count everything like towels, blankets etc (very annoying during checkout they inspect your room before you can leave. Don’t worry not stealing your old linens!!) -they said we broke a dental glass and charged us (it was not true, I feel like we were targeted because we were American. Glass was\\Ron\\Spent 4 nights here.. The room 504 is great with view of pool and beach.. Double bed and its spacious enough..Clean room clean bathroom daily house keeping daily complimentary water,  and toiletries and towels. The  main pool is awesome ! The other pool in the heritage area is ok too good for kiddos.  The kois are awesome ! They are huge !! I love them. The staffs are very very accomodatiing and helpful and very courteous andhelpful. The buffet breakfast has lots of choices, meat noodles, chicken, pancakes, omelets , breads, salad and fresh fruits...i enjoyed my breakfast here and leave with full tummy.  The rooftop bar has a stunning view in the area and the food is awesome! Really taste good. But a little pricey! But big servings !  The only downside is the beach area.  Not so\\ASF\\We had booked a suite with seaveiw 85m2 to have a little bit space on our holiday. The room we got was not even close to 85m2, maybe 50m2. The room was renovated recently but the handcraft was terrible performed. The lamp on the wall  come with heavy noises when it was on, the fuges between the tiles in the bathroom where broken and disgusting water came up when you walked on the bathroom floor. The shower was overflowing the floor and the bathtub didn't work. The smell on the bathroom was not roses. The facilities and area on the hotel was to small. The beach area is very small, the beach wasn't white and the tide difference where huge ( around 500meter). We tried to change hotel during the stay, but all hotels where full due to New Year. Try to stay away from the hotel if you\\Thierry E\\Visited the resort for 6 days. After a smooth check in we were given an extremely dated room at the heritage wing while an 'Grand Luxe room' of 42 sqm was booked. The room was very small and needed to be refurbished asap - these can simply not be sold as four star rooms. Anyway, after complaning we were transferred to a better room; the one week booked with is spacious. However, bathroom needs to be renewed, it is not what you might expect of a four staraccomodation. The big pool was very good but needs maintenance also. Food served in the restaurant is very good and this also counts for the 801 'room'. Breakfast is great. Also tried the spa which is (very) costly but very good. Would consider going back there if rooms/facilities are refurbished.\\dadbod088\\Had fun during our Company's summer anniversary. The resort has a nice pool, beach, and clean comfort rooms. The resort has a jet-ski, and banana boat rides. You can also do snorkeling and go for a boat tour.\\Gregory C\\I must say the the staff at White Sands is amazing. Grace at the front desk went out of her way to accommodate us completely. We were leaving at 2 am to go to Oslob to swim with the whale sharks and she offered to have breakfasts prepared and waiting for us when we left!  One of Porter’s named Noel also gave us incredible service and even gave us a little local history lesson while driving us to the Pier!  The servers at all the restaurants are Very accommodating and friendly!   The food prices are ok compared to US currency but high compared to local.   The restaurant  on the 8th floor of the tower has amazing food!  A VERY LONG WAIT but the view is beautiful!  Regarding the quality of the food: The American steaks they serve are “BETTER”. than most I’ve had in the states! Be\\AdventuresOfZolee\\It's a nice place to stay overall despite of ongoing refurbishment works ! I was intended to book a different nearby resort but when I have seen reviews of  ongoing construction works , opted for White sand resort as could not see reviews mentioning refurb here. Seems like all nearby establishments having some works done at the same time so it's a lot of grinding and banging on walls during daytime. Check-in time is unusually late it's 3pm. Just arrived half an hour before check-in and the suite was not ready yet. Friendly and professional service at reception and a welcome drink made up for that nuisance.  The room is  nice but dated also minibar is  only a few items . There are tea and coffee making facilities but only with one sachet of coffee.  Bathroom could have\\Silverswirls\\A day use experience with Cebu White Sands was an experience worth remembering.  Though the pool was not so big, but it was enough to cool our bodies against the summer heat of Cebu,  What is more appealing was the spread of the buffet.  For the price we paid for, it was a  great treat.  Not just because of the incredible food choices, but the hospitable and friendly services staff.    The wide garden, the architectural structure, the clean toilet and bath areas are some of the touches the hotel has to offer.  Of course the rates are not that quite reasonable.  Overall, it was a good choice to spend a lazy day.\\pnghenryb\\I arrived very late and had a very friendly reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The room was big and appropriate, nice bathroom and a view to the pool. the check out in the morning went well without any problem.\\Nive P\\A cozy and nice hotel just outside Cebu centrum, in Lapu Lapu. We stayed here for three days in total. The staff was very friendly and we were treated very good. The bar in the second floor is a place to check out as you get a fine view over Lapu Lapu and you could buy some drinks to enjoy with. The hotel was a bit pricey for us, but overall a good place. The road outside the hotel can be a bit busy and irritating in terms of different type of sellers that will approach you and won´t leave you alone. However I would recommend people to visit this hotel as a short-stay option rather than a long stay.\\Dada B\\As a conference organizer with participants coming from many different countries, I was at first worried about our choice of venue and acommodation due to some reviews written here. Also, unlike the standards of other countries like Thailand, there is much to be desired from Philippine hotel and conference facilities. But I was very grateful at the end that this resort--especially the staff--did their best to accommodate our various conference and accommodation needs, and exceeded my expectations. There really is nothing to complain about here, based on my experience. Positives: The grounds are spacious, there is a beachfront, and there are two swimming pools. They are both well kept. Our conference room was converted quite nicely according to our specifications, and the sales\\Kenneth O\\Stayed just one night here. Good proximity to the airport, approximately 20 minutes by taxi. Don't use the hotel's transfer service as it costs almost 3 times more than a taxi from street.  The grounds are very nice with some amazing koi ponds. The beach isn't great and is not conducive to swimming.  No Wi-Fi in the rooms but it's pretty good in the common areas.  Overall a pretty decent hotel but definitely overpriced and could certainly do with a makeover.\\Grincoffeeman\\We stayed here with my family by recommendation of family friends. The new building is nice, our room has good airconditioned and the huge pool is awesome which my children enjoyed.there is nearest supermarket as well. Breakfast is nothing special, even omellette. The restaurant in roofdeck is a plus points as it has a nice view and good ambiance. Frontdesk needs to know proper engagement to the guest disregards of the nationality. I think korean is more important to them. That stay is our last stay, there neighbor resort is much better hospitality service and facilities.\\mikeyk64\\We arrived at checkin to be provided with instructions instead of a welcome with a list of house rules including the fact the room was booked for two persons and only two could use a room. Also a house room that visitors had to remain in the public areas.   We had arrived expecting to be housed on a semi suite next to the adults only pool. We were instead house in the main block but given a suite. The room itself was decent enough without being luxurious.  It also had for some reason a kitchen sink in an area called the reception area.  This conflicts with the fact you can't have visitors in your room.  Can't see the point in that wasted space which was very utilitarian.    The hotel on the whole is very dated and in need of refurbishment. The lifts smelled as there didn't\\NunoL2\\Nice service, good breakfast, but rooms and structure is dated, needs some refurbishment. Beach is clean but the sea is so flat and low that you can't dive. Nice place to stay but a bit expensive for the age.\\Natacha S\\Stayed 1 night in order be closer to airport( came from malapascua) smooth check in and clean quiet room. Whole resort seems calm not much ppl even though it's high season. Breakfast buffe good but not so much interesting food for lunch or dinner.  Easy access to cheap spa, massage and restaurants only a short walk from hotel."
