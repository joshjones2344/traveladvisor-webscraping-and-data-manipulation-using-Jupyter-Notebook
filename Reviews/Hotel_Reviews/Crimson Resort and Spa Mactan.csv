This moment already gave us the impression that we would enjoy our stay.   Our room was clean, spacious, and perfectly situated near the main pool and beach.   We went on with our day and got to meet a lot of their staff who took the time to check in on us and greeted us along the way.   They are really proactive in letting us know what activities they have and other upcoming activities for the day.   We watched their evening ritual and enjoyed night swimming with my sisters.   On the next day, we  had breakfast at Enye and the food was delicious!   After breakfast, we went on to enjoy the pool and got to experience their pool foam party! The very reason why we\\Mark B\\We spent 2 nights @ crimson machan. From the moment we arrived to the time we left I couldn't fault. The staff in all area's were exceptional. A special mention to the breakfast staff ""Sarah"" and ""Junrey""who couldn't do enough to help you and to  ""Juvz""at the cafe near the pool, who served us ""Johnny Water"" and Happy Hour SML with style.\\Sunshine50865490407\\Best service! They surprised my daughter with a birthday greeting and a cake. We were all shocked and happy at the same time. Our daughter loves Crimzone lots of activities for them to do. Super friendly staff. The food as always is delicious!!! I highly recommend to stay at least 2 nights to fully enjoy every facility and amenities they have. If you are looking for an escape and best staycation experience make it Crimson Resort and Spa. Thank you again for giving our daughter the best birthday bash! Cheers! To more experiences and adventures to come. See you again soon.\\bianca c\\Our experience was perfect. The rooms were incredibly clean, the staff were attentive and friendly. There was impeccable attention to detail in every corner of the resort. We came with children and never felt that they were a bother.\\David B\\Great food,  excellent service,  always a favorite. Rooms are excellent and comfortable and the facilities first class.  Crimson is one of our favorite resorts and we will keep coming back again and again.\\Anton del Prado\\I just came from the resort and their service exceeded my expectations! Service was excellent from top to bottom. It was so personalized that I took note of each person's name and what they did for us.  Herley - We were fortunate enough to be invited by her for their opening promo prior to their grand launch. We booked 2 nights and this is where it all started.   Gel - She welcomed us at the lobby and brought us directly to our room for the check-in transaction. On the way to the room she talked to us about the amenities of the resort.  Jester- She was awesome with her warm, never-ending smile and prompt service. She talked with us every time we bumped into each other. She was always asking us how our stay was and if we needed anything.  Liza - invited us to play life-sized\\Nyree R\\Spend a great weekend with my husband and friends. Staffs are so friendly. They had an honest bell man that returned my white and yellow gold bracelet in their lost and found section. Thank you very much.\\Opsrey a\\We had the best time in Crimson.  Spent the weekend with my family and we couldn‚Äôt ask for more.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. We all loved the activities the resort offers - foam party, playtime for kids at crimzone, fish feeding and so much more. Breakfast was superb and food at Enye is amazing. Asado was my favorite.  The thoughtful amenities upon arrival and at night is just impressive.   Highly recommended for families! We will be back for sure.\\Georgia May K\\Crimson resort is now our family's favorite resort.  The staff are very helpful, courteous and very professional. Food is excellent.  The resort is probably one of the most beautiful place if not the best in Cebu.\\Kiana s\\Services and staffs are 100% accomodating and they make sure you have all the needs of your stay and as well as you've enjoyed your stay. This is my first time checking in crimson mactan, Foods are tasty and comfortable to walk around. All of their staffs and crews are well-mannered.\\TheLaagan\\It was indeed a well spent long weekend and a best choice of place to celebrate my birthday. Every staff is always wearing a smile. Special thanks to Ms. Aizel, Ms. Jesster and the rest of the Front Office staff for making sure we enjoy our stay. The birthday cake is so delicious, really didn't expect to have that in our room the moment we checked in. My mom really enjoyed her swimming time from the crimzone pool, infinity pool to the white sand beach. We ate dinner at Kalma. The food is worthy of the price and is served on time. A wide variety of food is also served for breakfast buffet(I preferred their setup over the themed breakfast buffet of another resort in Marigondon). We stayed at a deluxe room which is spacious enough, and has complete basic amenities. The WiFi\\Judy D\\It's my second time staying at Crimson Mactan and as expected warm hospitality welcomes you the moment you arrive.The staff are very generous. Food is great especially the breakfast buffet. Rooms are spacious, comfy and clean. Crystal clear infinity pool and white sand beach. All you need to relax, Crimson has it. Can't wait to be back.\\Thara B.\\We originally had a reservation for January 2022, to celebrate our wedding anniv, but Typhoon Odette happened December 2021.  The resort was badly affected thus they needed to close for renovation.  We were promptly refunded for that.  Then we bought their voucher Feb last year, hoping to visit them when they open again, but had no chance to use it sooner since the renovation really took time (still on the process of renovating other parts of the resort, but no worries, coz the on-going work is not bothersome to guests).  Then, finally we got an email invite from them for their soft opening.  So we grabbed the chance to stay for the long weekend, and we were not disappointed.  Reservation officer Em-Ar was so considerate to accomodate our request to move our reservation (though\\Yancy C\\The rooms are squeaky clean. Spacious. And the resort itself is really breathtaking. The staffs are superb! Especially Aizel and Jesster who granted our requests. Also Norman, Gino & Jojo for helping us out in our requests while staying. And the icing on the cake was the sweet surprise from their staff namely Aimi and Jay my parents were really happy spending another milestone as a wedded couple and we could not be more happier. Will surely recommend Crimson Mactan not only to my family and friends but also to the world!\\◊†◊ï◊¢◊î ◊û\\A stunning hotel. Amazingly designed. A pampering pool and a great breakfast. There is an happy hour in the pool bar for the cocktails and they are very tasty. The food we ordered at the pool bar was also excellent. The staff is so nice and helpful in everything we asked for. And especially  cute vincci!! helped us every time we asked and always with a smile, definitely ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏ègreatly ,improving our experience\\nechama w\\Such a gorgeous resort with a stunning pool and beach. Everything was clean and the staff were so helpful and friendly. We were looked after in particular by Juvz and I got a massage by Ann which was amazing! Overall highly recommend and can‚Äôt wait to visit again. Thank you\\Corazon C\\We booked 7 rooms for an impromptu bday celebration for my tita with Immediate family. It was indeed worth the wait ..after being closed for more than a year. Service was excellent from the moment we stepped inside the resort until the next day when we checked out. The rooms were clean, comfortable with a special mini bar treat. Loved the nespresso  machines in the rooms. Reminded me of the kdrama  King The Land...Dinner  at Enye was also a perfect way to celebrate my tita s bday...all the staff ..from the front desk, maintenance, pool attendants, room attendants, waiters, housekeepers made us feel welcome.Good Job on the re opening of Crimson  Mactan!!!!\\Juno V\\The experience was superb from check-in to checkout. The ambiance was very welcoming and also the staff. We only stayed for a night but the memories it gave us remain forever. The food at Enye was world-class and the room amenities were generous. I was gladly surprised by the Crimson Tote Bag and the hat!\\Capt. Dexter Wong\\We had a wonderful stay at Crimson Resort and Spa Mactan with my family. Ms. Jester, the guest officer and the rest of her team warmly greeted us upon arrival and was exceptionally attentive throughout our three-day stay, constantly checking in on us. Norman, who drives the golf cart ensured the proper transport of our luggage and safely brought us to our room and to the parking area when we left.  Ms. Liza and the rest of the crimzone crew were extremely helpful in entertaining and assisting my kids while they played in the playroom. The Enye crew were also very friendly and provided outstanding service everytime we had our breakfast there.  Overall the entire Crimson staff exceeded  our expectations. They were all exeptional and we would highly recommend Crimson Resort and Spa\\guillente\\The aircon is like an oven.  So hot! The place is not family oriented and they are foreign friendly.  Not suitable for locals.  The service crew especially the ACU repairman was not available.  So, the imconveniences were not addressed right away.\\Ian\\We had a gathering event in a Coral Ballroom. The ambiance and table setting was great, the food was excellent and the teams were polite, friendly and helpful. Special thanks to Mr. Warren & Ms. Candy for accommodating us till the end.\\Wander07389151035\\All I can say is two thumbs up. Service was impeccable, and the resort itself was divine, very aesthetic, immaculate and soooo relaxing. Upon arrival at the resort, the views were amazing, especially in the day.  The rooms were relaxing and clean, and the staff was friendly and reliable  regaedless, when asked for any service. Lots of options for in-resort and  beachfront activities, so you won't be bored. Definitely highly recommended  for any guest local or international, you won't be disappointed!\\Julianne M\\Crimson Mactan went above and beyond to make us feel at home. The staff was warm, courteous, attentive and quick to respond. Breakfast spread was incredible, props to the head chef who made sure everything that comes out of the kitchen is of quality. We chose Crimson as our wedding venue and while it rained during our reception, the whole team was quick to respond to transfer everyone to the ballroom to keep the party going! They were also generous enough to hold a foam pool party for us the day after the wedding. The premises were clean and beautiful, rooms are cozy... we have no regrets with holding the best day of our lives at Crimson Mactan!\\Patrice\\Aside from the access to the infinity pool and the cleanliness of the premises, the service was deplorable and the security staff rather rude and pretentious, especially at the entrance to the resort. We won't be coming here again.\\Luna F\\GOOD - When you head to your room, take a moment to appreciate the garden view. It offers a distinct blend of urban tranquility unlike what you'll find at other resorts in the city. It's a wonderfully beautiful setting that will make your stay even more memorable. - The pool area is stunning and would make a great backdrop for photos. JUST OKAY -The lighting in the room is a bit low, which bothers me but could be pleasant for others.\\Donna Faith A\\My family enjoyed our stay at Crimson. Amenities are superb and world-class. Rooms and entire vicinity are clean. The villa in which we stayed was the best! We had a great experience from check in to departure. Everything was fast, smooth snd organized. Perfect service indeed. Crimson staff is the best!  Everyone we met was friendly and accomodating, ready to serve, answered all queries and met our needs.  Crimson will have a special place in our hearts! Thank you Crimson for everything! God bless! :)\\sue p\\Lovely place to stay, Rooms are clean,  true to authentic filipino style, comfortable and really well designed. The little veranda is a nice place at evenings or early mornings when you get lazy to stroll anywhere else.  the beach while not that long or wide was well kept, white and sandy, against the water so clean and blue.  Staff are absolutely smiling all the way through - such a filipino culture! So accommodating and no request too big!  Pools are well placed and the view is outstanding. Food is forgettable but really it's not bad, it's just not what I got for the price I paid but it was fine.   All in all would certainly go back and defo well and truly worth recommending!\\Rose Anne T\\We were given a voucher from our company to crimson hotel, alabang.  We were surprised with the accomodations, assistance and hospitality of all your staffs. From the lobby, concierge, amenities areas, front desk, guards, as in lahat po. They were all nice and always sending smiles after you asked them a favor.  Special mention to Ms. Karen of Lobby, she did a great job assisting our concerns, orders and everything we ask her. Very accomodating po. Thank you ms. Karen ha.  To sir Ian of front desk, you are the best. You deserve to be on a higher spot. Aside from your good looking, you have a kind heart inside. You gave us considerations and make us feel welcome and comfortable in staying at your hotel, since first time po namin here.  Hindi kami nahirapan over all. We enjoyed!"
