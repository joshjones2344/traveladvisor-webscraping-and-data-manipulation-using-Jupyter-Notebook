Downside was a lounge access room was disappointing and the lounge closed which we had to find out only when we wanted to visit prior or on arrival notification would be expected from a 5 star hotel. Location I feel is poor unless you a stay in hotel person ..\\NorthStar61210995783\\Staff was very friendly and helpful. The pool is very large and comfortable. Also, the food is very good! You can spend all day at the hotel alone. The hotel was lit up at night and was very beautiful.\\Trek16710771238\\This is the best hotel! とてもスタッフの皆さんが親切にしてくれて最高の旅行になりました！！ come buck soon! JOMARさんはすごく明るくて楽しい人です！また会いにきたいです！！ファンになりました〜！  ステーキはミディアムレアが美味しいのと夜はプールの人が少ないです！ セキュリティもしっかりしていて部屋の清掃も完璧でした！  thank you so much!!\\Andrew B\\Amazing staff! So friendly and accommodating, beautiful hotel with stunning views, the pool and board walk is a great place to relax all day and take photos. Clint was the best waiter we could ask for\\Annabella O\\Loved the service! The scenery is really good! The food was so-so at the Sunset bar, but the buffet breakfast at Tradewinds was awesome! Special shoutout to Febe for being so kind, friendly and looking after us so well! The staff at the egg station makes really good omelettes too! Ask for the sea view room! Do note there’s not much of a beach though, and come early for breakfast if you want a table outside facing the sea!\\경 민\\I asked the front desk for help to eat Jollibee, which I really wanted to try in Cebu. (We couldn't use the Grab application) Ericson, a front desk clerk, made a great effort to order the menu from his personal cell phone. It was very touching to try to fulfill the request that the hotel system could not make. While trying to order, Jollibee's business hours were over, so we couldn't eat it, but later he found a Jollibee that wasn't closed personally and showed it to us. (Then we were in the pool and he came to see us himself!) But we had already placed an order at the hotel restaurant Sunset Bar. I couldn't eat Jollibee because it was the last day of our trip, but I was very touched by his passionate service. All the facilities in the hotel were excellent, the staff were\\윤경 이\\Every employees are kind  I ate pizza and cocktails  I love here cocktails I fall in love with cosmopolitan  Thank u for good service !  It was good vacation If u visit sunset bar u can see nice scenery\\Mississippi Analytics\\The place is a slice of paradise, no doubt. The beach, the swanky rooms, it's like stepping into a dream. But here's the thing: their Wi-Fi game. I mean, you're in this stunning tropical heaven, but the Wi-Fi acts like it's on a beach vacation too – super slow and kinda unreliable. So if you're planning to upload all those jealousy-inducing beach pics or even just stream your favorite show, you might be in for some frustration. It's like paradise with a side of digital detox, whether you asked for it or not! 🏖️📶\\Michael T\\Very bad check-in experience, they were able to give the requested room at 3:45 pm where in the checkin time is 3 pm.  Unprofessional front desk manager and receptionists.  Pricey buffet food, not so special and they are very slow in refilling the food items.  Would not recommend this place\\OnAir684175\\Our stay at the Dusit Thani was exceptional. From the moment we checked in we could not fault the resort or the service. The buffet breakfast was amazing, the facilities and the pool were world class and the bar service from JV and Lee was wonderful. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone considering a vacation in Cebu\\재석 이\\EDZEZ NOTWIN is very kind, and awesome!!!  I visited for the 1st anniversary of my marriage and it was nice to meet a good staff.  It was very delicious and the staff was very friendly.   I will visit again\\FourAs\\(-) The soundproofing of the room needs improvement, we can hear the next room watching TV, moving their stuffs. The room itself is quite basic same as the bathroom for the price paid or for a Dusit Thani hotel.  A bathtub would have been nice as commented by my son.  Bath towels seem like beach towels, they were too big. We were told that our rooms have king sized beds, there were twin beds.  (+) Dusit Thani hospitality still felt and happy about it. Great staff from the arrival, restaurants, housekeeping, pool, ground, they were friendly and genuine. No problem with parking.  Sunset view was superb either from the infinity pool or the bar.  On food, we had the following: in this order ---- dessert and coffee at The Deli, merienda at Sunset Sports Bar, dinner at Benjarong and\\Delyn M\\The service was very good, and our stay was so relaxing. This place is great for relaxation and to unwind. The amenities, activities and swimming locations was superb! Good value for the money and the breakfast was delicious.  I had a great experience with one of the staff Joey he was very hospitable and helpful for every need of mine. 10/10 recommended and will go again.\\Jamessl M\\Absolutely brilliant, Great atmosphere, Wonderful food and Beautiful Room view. The is a little bit far away from the City,but great place to relax and enjoy the sunset and infinity pool. Friendly staff specially Joey the one cleaning my room thank you buddy and to Dusit staff.\\Haven A.\\I love spending so much time in here. Everything was nice! The room was very spacious, clean, and had the amenities we needed. Breakfast was delicious and with many choices; it was a very wide buffet spread. The staff here Gabriel and Christy were very pleasant, helpful and catered our needs extremely well. They are amazing and could not have been more accommodating. I would recommend to my friends, and will definitely stay again if Im back to Cebu.\\stevekettle\\Fun place - rooms good and serviced well , good F&B , service can be hit & miss but generally with a smile , so as long as you not in a rush all good . Massive pool , and places upbeat music so not for a quiet time .. would recommend ...... be prepared to wait at peak hours for breakfast\\Seung eun L\\Norwin treated us kindly, so we made a good memory!  And place was convenient to eat because it was right in front of the swimming pool!!    Also the cocktail recommendation was very good :) thanks!!\\chunghun ha\\I stayed at the Dujithani Hotel for 2 nights and 3 days and used the club lounge. The memories here were so good. Both afternoon tea and dinner-time services provided the best food, location and service. The staff here, especially Gerson, was kind, took pictures of us, and treated us very well. If I come to the Philippines next time, I will use the Dujithani Hotel again and reserve a club room where the club lounge is always available.\\Martha M\\I admire everything! This place is very tremendous, charming and lavish. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. Facilities are great and modern. The pool was very beautiful and warm. The room was so comfy, especially the pillows. I love this hotel!"
