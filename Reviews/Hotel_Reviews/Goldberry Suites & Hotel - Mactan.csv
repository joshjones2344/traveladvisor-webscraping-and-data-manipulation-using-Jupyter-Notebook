Goldberry Suites & Hotel - Mactan,"bow_bow45\\Hotel is small & quaint. Recently refurbished so most of items are fully equipped and in working condition. Front desk staff, Geneva, provided a personalized touch, good job! Located in busy main road, just ignore the sound of constant traffic. Had a pretty good sleep. Good location as it's near to airport & slightly further from the city. Saves the time stuck in peak period traffic.\\dhor o\\Awesome service and friendly employees, always willing to help. Pick up & drop off to the airport is always on time. Food is delicious, and the rooms are always clean. Highly recommended  to stay here if you decide  to travel  to Cebu.\\Leslie C\\We only stayed two nights on our return from Bantayan, on our way to Boracay. The close proximity to the airport made bit a good selection. They had a small restaurant downstairs which was ideal, in that we didn‚Äôt have to go out to eat. The food was quite good. We found the breakfast to be lacking a bit, as there wasn‚Äôt a big selection to choose from. The room was small, but comfortable. We had a problem with the hot water to the shower. They tried to fix, unsuccessfully. There were no power points on the bench to change the phone. They provided a shuttle service to the airport. Overall it was ok. Would probably stay there again.\\Agot76\\This is indeed a really good hotel especially when you are in quarantine. Although we didn't get to explore the place since you know, we are in quarantine but I can say the services and the staffs were all attentive to our needs. Their service is exceptional to say the least. From the pick up at the airport to finding a car/van to use for travel to the next island everybody were very helpful. I was so impressed by their services that I told my niece who is visiting Cebu too to book from this hotel for her quarantine. Keep it up guys!\\Cielo P\\Mom and I needed a room for the night near the airport since our flight the next day is very early. It's a clean quaint hotel with a resto. I found it expensive considering the size of the hotel and rooms with no windows but mom was quite satisfied. That's all that matters. Your pillows may need changing.\\Cat\\We had a very comfortable stay at Goldberry, the room was very spacious for two people and would recommend to book the suite room with the balcony especially when quarantining for a few days so that you have private access to outdoor space. The staff were very friendly and super helpful. The food provided from the Rabbit Hole was above average, we had a mixture of the quarantine menu and a la carte which was good. The wifi was very reliable and fast, I was able to do work online, watch shows on Netflix smoothly and connect well with relatives/friends abroad easily. The facilities in the room were very good and it was very clean. I definitely recommend a stay at Goldberry.\\rezeille\\A guide for the Quarantined.   This hotel is outstanding!  - very friendly and accommodating staff - very clean and comfortable room  - free airport shuttle, less than 10mins drive from the airport  - adheres to COVID protocols  I highly recommend this place! Yes it‚Äôs not Dusit Thani but for the price and their positive points, I say, ‚Äúbook it!‚Äù I‚Äôve been to many hotels all over the world, their staff and cleanliness definitely beats most of them!   Despite being under the strain of the pandemic, the staff are genuinely friendly and very efficient too with my requests.  Their compassion for the quarantined-tired-to the bone-travelers is evident in their interactions with me‚Äîthey even called me twice because I forgot to call them for my meals (jet lagged). Now, that‚Äôs quality\\Aeeo73\\We have stayed at this Goldberry location before, prior to Covid. And now is our first choice that they are accredited. It‚Äôs not the cheapest choice. But, the choice we know of, as the staff here has always been friendly and they offer free airport transport. Best of all their deluxe rooms have balconies of various sizes. They also offer standard rooms and suites for different budgets. The Goldberry is more in-line with a western styled hotel, as opposed to the Asian brand smaller sized rooms. The rooms are mostly spacious but very in size and are mostly clean. Although Mactan‚Äôs location is showing wear. They provide direct booking with full board or on-line booking with only free breakfast. Meals for lunch and dinner at an additional cost with full room service available.  So I\\Diomedes E\\I would not have survived a long 10-day hotel quarantine without good staff service by Goldberry Mactan! I asked for a room with windows, and I was given a spacious room with sliding doors and a balcony.  The bed was big and comfortable. There was a community below me, and by keeping the doors open the whole day, I did not feel alienated because I felt like I was part of the community's daily activity. Thanks to Geneva and Maimai of front desk! Thanks also to the resto staff for accommodating my meal requests, it can be difficult making a choice for 3 meals ordered for 10 days while being locked in a room for quarantine. The meal servers were prompt too. My request for a late checkout was easily granted too. I believe I survived because Goldberry is competent as a quarantine\\Erine\\Highly recomended this hotel. Very amazing staff & the place so neat & clean .Rooms are very cozy & warmüòä. The food so yummy & tasty.Special  thanks to Jasmin front desk for being so helpful for booking our room.\\TravelerFromTokyo\\You pay about $50 for this hotel.  In the US you would pay at least $100+ for a similar level airport hotel.  $200+ in big cities.  Hotel is clean, beds are comfortable, rooms big, airport transfer is easy & quick.  Breakfast sucks but you can‚Äôt have everything.  Overall, great.\\DivingTropical\\This Hotel is a good choice. Close to airport with free airport transfer. Lots of food options around. Hotel is nice and comfortable with all you would need for a day or two stay. The breakfast is a little weak compared to western standards but it's ok. We filled out and honest comment card and maybe the will improve slightly. Just small first world issues. They were out of beans 45 mins before closing, when we asked for more they put one spoonful in there I assume so they wouldnt possibly have to waste anything. The lady working at the breakfast had exceptional service. Everyone in the hotel went above and beyond to please you. Good Job!\\Shirrrbyyy\\This hotel is located right close to Cebu International Airport. Perfect to stay if you have a flight to catch the next day. I stayed in one of the suite rooms. Bed was comfy and the balcony was pretty spacious. You get a view of the local Mactan life. The bummer was the shower though, as there was no additional shower head and the water was lukewarm. Other than that, the location is convenient as you can walk to local eateries, and to one of the bigger malls as well. But do remember to take a taxi back when it gets dark (especially for a solo female traveler). The breakfast was decent as well. Actually, definitely better than what I had in Bohol!! And the free shuttle service to the airport was excellent!\\FrankieDP\\We were travelling from the UK with a night stop in Mactan.  I made my booking through Booking.com and contacted the hotel to avail the shuttle service using the email address provided by Booking.com  The hotel confirmed within 12 hours and the shuttle service was excellent.  We asked for a quiet room and they upgraded free of charge to the back of the property.  The room was spacious, the king size bed very comfortable and there was plenty of choice in the mini bar.  The rooms and corridors are a little dark but the whole place was spotlessly clean.  I particularly enjoyed the on site massage facility and the small caf√©/ restaurant serving simple food.  The breakfast choice and quality was good and staff very helpful.  I asked for two fried eggs, over easy, and they were\\SunsetStMartin\\An overall fantastic place to stay in that's near the airport!  The bed was very comfortable, there was hot water, the wifi worked well even inside the rooms, there's also a water boiler available in the room, and the breakfast buffet was so good! The fish, and the corn beef was so delicious!   The food in the restaurant, the Rabbit Hole underneath the hotel was also very good! I specially really loved the kimchi fried rice. Excellent value and very delicious!  The hotel also offered a free-drop off shuttle service from the hotel to the airport.   The staff was also very helpful, and pleasant.  Cons: Perhaps the cons for this place is that it's more expensive compared to the other hotels in this road/area, but it's well worth it, and it gets your money worth.   Will overall\\zenny T\\This place is near the airport and its a nice hotel with a huge room and big balcony and food are great room service is fast and wifi is okay as well..room is clean and staff makes you feel you are well entertain\\Paul G\\We were in the deluxe room which is very large, has balcony seating and was very quiet. The furniture and bedding was very comfortable and we had a great time relaxing cocooned from the rest of the world.   Overall the room was very clean with just a little bit more detail on the glass shower screens and mirrors required.   The staff were very friendly and helpful and I would be happy to come back just for that level of service.\\rosaspandan\\Room was huge with balcony and seating areas. Shower/sundries were great. Staff were friendly and very close to the airport.  They provided airport transport even very late at night and early a.m.  Free breakfast at an attached restaurant was OK.\\Travel_Lover0316\\Hotel is close to Mactan airport and provides free shuttle. Staff are friendly and accommodating. This hotel is close to marina mall and island center mall. Accessible to the new and old bridge. They have a restaurant that offers variety of food for bfast.\\VinceofOrmoc\\I love the place. Very clean and impressive. Quite expensive but you'll have buffet breakfast.  Internet is slow but manageable. It's also 10 minutes away from the airport, definitely a perfect place to stay if you need to be near the airport. But again, this is not an ordinary hotel so it's quite expensive.\\violetvodka\\very near the airport. used an airport taxi and meter ran only to 120.  the next day from the hotel to airport, it was barely 80 using a regular taxi.  comfy bed, quiet place to sleep.  room came with breakfast, but it wasnt so great.  very ordinary breakfast buffet.  i think only the cornflakes tasted okay.\\Glenn P\\Fantastic hotel, and service. Rooms are big and beautiful. The hotel staff is friendly, professional and helpful. Highly recommended. The bed are big, soft and they have thick blanked. Aircon and TV. Internet is slow. The room have dark and mood wood interior.\\SEdgSantos\\Me, My partner & Two of my siblings enjoyed our stay at Goldberry Suites during the Sinulog Season. They have a very helpful reservation team who assisted me adjust my booking at such a short notice (as one of my sibling only decided come to with us to Cebu at the last minute). I did agreed to pay for an extra person & roll away bed. As it was a peak season I know most of the hotel are fully booked. Yet Reservation/Front office management manage to give us an upgrade to a Suite to accommodate all four of us which is very much appreciated by myself and everyone.\\mjmboogie\\I was upgraded to the best room they had at no charge. The room was very spacious & clean. There was some noise from the traffic at street level. The hotel is located on a main busy road, but it gets quite as the city winds down. The price did include a free shuttle to the airport, they have their own van. A free breakfast was also included. The close proximity to the airport makes this a good choice if making an early flight is a concern. Traffic to the airport is a non issue when you are this close. I would also recommend this for business travelers doing business on Mactan. Booked thru TripAdvisor, maybe that is why I got up graded. But I never asked.\\Clarisse M\\Booked a one night stay at the hotel. A good place to stay if you do not want to be tangled in the traffic of Cebu City especially if you are catching a flight. The hotel offers free airport pick-up/ drop-off.  Its location is perfect for hailing cabs and jeepneys but the hotel is not close to the Cebu city tourist attractions.   Staff are accommodating.\\SunnyJung0526\\I choose this hotel due to close location from Mactan Airport. I got hotel pick-up service from airport although it's 3am. I booked Deluxe room it was very spacious and cleaned. Amenities are enough and air conditioner was well-functioned. Free breakfast was included and all tastes good!:-) After check-out, I asked to drop-off at nearest supermarket and hotel staff kindly did drop-off service. It was my first night in Cebu and staying this hotel makes me fresh start in Cebu. I will definitely use this hotel again when I visit Cebu again. :-)\\Zephyr1103\\My nth time to stay in Goldberry Suites & Hotel, still having those warm treatment from their  personnel, Keep it up guys....Nino, Lady, Lilian and May May even Geneva?? the OJT....to and from the Airport....thanks to their drivers...Marco??, Ric , Melvin....There's always a room for improvement though, breakfast?? yahh must focus there guys....not bad, but an improvement will be very much appreciated.>>>>>Romeo of ""B""\\Cindyrella C\\They have a shuttle service, good breakfast, midnight check-ins. All in its price. Rooms are clean and decent and staff are kind and friendly. I had a lovely experience. I was surprised of the late check-ins but it suits well for transit passengers.\\Hermione G\\I had a good experience here  not to mention the friendly stuff , complimentary , perfect ambiance of rooms  , good food , exquisite wine , I will surely vouch your hotel to my friends. ‚ù§Ô∏è - last minute holiday\\Mona081967\\Everything was great, the room and the location.  We loved the place and  we will definitely go back! The graveyard shift staff were nice too.  The night shift who checked us in was not though. NOT welcoming or anything. Seemed we were just distracting him. Otherwise, I would really recommend this place."
