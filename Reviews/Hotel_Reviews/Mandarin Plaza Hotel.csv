Mandarin Plaza Hotel,"Marine\\We stayed for one night and headed to another city. Can't wait to be back there for my last night in Cebu tomorrow! Here is why: -the check-in was smooth and fast.  -ideally situated right next to Ayala Center -staff at the concierge is very knowledgeable and knows how to help people and give good advices. -the room is BIG! And overall good cleanliness. It was not ""spotless"" because the hotel is not new. Some things look used but absolutely not dirty. We asked for more toilet paper and the houseman who came saw that we had no bottles of water (actually we put them in the fridge haha) so he brought us two extra more without us asking anything. Good hotelier sense! -the breakfast was A-MA-ZING. Lots of choices to please every client (asian + western dishes) -we also used the\\bob1cat\\We stayed two nights at the Mandarin Plaza hotel which is about 300M walk to the Ayala mall if you need to go shopping.  The hotel does not have a shuttle to the airport or harbor for ferry service but taxi's are available for 250 - 500 pesos.  The breakfast buffet was better than we expected with both hot and cold items to choose from. Refills were no problem.  A few items on the buffet change daily.  If we needed to visit the Ayala mall we would stay there again.\\Olivia d\\This hotel is fabulous, not only is it centrally located but the hotel has everything you want..reasonably priced, spotless rooms, great showers and good wifi. The hotel has a pool, sauna and restaurant. We ate here two nights and the food was delicious and cheap too. The staff were what made the stay however, they were so helpful and friendly, from the concierge to the wait staff. So thank-you!\\Teresa B\\The room was spacious, clean and the food at breakfast was alright. Though at the time of checking in there was one lady on duty, it took a little bit of time to get my turn in the queue, but at least she gave me the room on the 17th floor. It was quiet and good view of the city lights.\\livi88\\Good standard hotel. Room Was clean and comfortable. Food is average but very reasonable. Very friendly staff. Ideal location for Cebu city - directly across from the mall. Not a whole heap to do in Cebu city itself but good location to do day trips from.\\Cameron B\\On my first impression of the room was wow...it was a great size, very spacious. Staff were always friendly and helpful, especially when i asked for a TV remote control, as the rooms only come with a cable TV remote and i wanted to play media from my personal hard drive. Buffet breakfast was good, plenty of choices, both western and Asian cuisine available...the only negative i found was the bacon...not everyone likes crispy bacon. Location is great, a short walk to Ayala Mall and the must try House of Lechon (it was so good i went back 2 nights in a row) Pool was good, gym was a little hard to find (not that i used it) Overall i enjoyed my stay at the Mandarin Plaza Hotel and when i visit Cebu again, i wont hesitate booking here again.\\CheriedPretty\\My mother and I stayed in this hotel overnight and boy, I was surprised how the hotel's interior design and magnificent color mesmerized me. the entrance lobby looked so grand with crystal chandelier hanging over an oversized centerpiece. The room (superior room) was equipped with ref, hair dryer, slippers, laundry bags, and complimentary drinks. Although there was nothing on the bar, still i appreciate the cleanliness and orderliness of the entire room. The room service was prompt and the restaurant was open until 11:30PM! The food selection was not many but sufficently delicious and varied...there are cereals and congee for the kids too. the breads are fresh. This hotel definitely deserve my second visit!\\Arra Ezekiel N\\Pro - Near shopping center / Ayala IT Park (3-5 mins walk) - Near the pier (20mins by car) - Food is great - Accommodating and very kind staff - Clean and spacious room and toilet. - taxis are lined up outside - fast internet connection  Cons - Same breakfast menu everyday (buffet) - When I stayed there last April 1 2018, the bedsheets had stains and the bath towel was frayed and torn - 45mins travel from the airport\\Dorothy W\\Really enjoyed my stay here. Warm friendly welcome. The hotel is close to Ayala mall which has a large selection of shops, bars and restaurants. Room very clean and communal areas. Staff helpful and professional.\\Richard H\\First, let me speak of the hotel. This was my second stay, and it would have been my third, had they not been booked up on my last minute trip a month before. I love this place and the staff, not to mention the close proximity to the large mall. I’ve done a lot of traveling in the U.S. and across Asia. Often, even nice places have flaws and aging, especially in the bathrooms. This place is always spotless and in excellent condition. On this stay, I needed a toothbrush, and seeing an employee in the hall, mentioned it. She wasn’t a housekeeper and didn’t have anything with her, but when I returned to my room, two toothbrushes and extra T/P awaited me. Now, for the rave. I was extremely stressed on this trip and did something totally out of character: I left my passport and PHP\\Steve J\\I travel...A LOT!  This was my first stay at the Mandarin, and I will be back! It is conveniently located to Ayala Mall and many other Cebuano musts...like great cuisine and professional massage parlors, such as Nuai Thai, just a stones throw from the Mandarin, but well worth the short walk.    I arrived late at night from the USA, so a speedy, helpful, and friendly check-in process was a must. Justine and Christian made this possible! My room was clean, comfortable, and the aircon was good...but not great. The bed was amazing, and the WiFi way more than adequate! The rooms are also very spacious, which is helpful since most international travelers arrive with a lot of luggage.    The breakfast buffet, which is included with your room, was very good, and the pancit canton I had\\loida gac-ang\\I enjoyed while staying at this beautiful place.They have yummy and unlimitted food.Good ambiance at the dining place. Accomodating staff and crew. The place were very nice and so accessible because it is located near the mall.\\JinDee8\\We enjoyed our stay at the Mandarin Plaza. Our room was very spacious, and we really appreciated the complimentary bottled water, and coffee bar. The hotel was nice and clean, and staff was friendly and accommodating. Our only gripe is the limited selection for the breakfast buffet, but we are grateful that they even offer it for free, so can't really complain. We recommend this hotel, especially if you want to be close to Ayala Center.\\Marlaine Hope R\\Aside from booking a room for an affordable price, the place was huge and just enough for my active two year old son to run around to his heart content. Cozy and spacious. Breakfast was a buffet of sumptuous food. A feast for my eyes and stomach early in the morning.\\Aggeliki K\\Beautiful hotel with nice rooms and pleasant environment, tight in the central of the city. I tried the cocktails at night with relaxing live piano music. The rooms are quite big and nice, and friendly staff.\\Patricia P\\Loved staying at this hotel.  Breakfast buffet was fantastic with different food options available.  Room service facilities excellent, such as house slippers and bag for groceries.  Tea and coffee with fresh water provided every day.\\Nicx\\This hotel is value for money. It's hard to find a hotel in the heart of Cebu City with a bath tub for two thousand pesos. The hotel is clean, big, with free breakfast, tasty in-room dining service, walking distance to a mall, with pool, bar, restaurant and friendly staff. Will come back if I am in Cebu again.\\Seaside750551\\They are very strict with the check in and out times, but they have great rooms and facilities and delicious buffet. The location is convenient to Ayala Malls but a bit crowded. I would recommend this.\\The Aimless traveller\\If you’re a solo or business traveler needing peace and quiet, keep in mind that it’s full of group tourists and families, and in a crowded part of Cebu. Otherwise it’s an excellent comfortable hotel with all amenities, good breakfast and polite staff.\\Judfae M\\I checked in on July 7 and out on the 9th with a friend. I was surprised by the spacious room with basic amenities. You can have the other needs upon request.   I thought the rate would be much higher..but it was affordable.  It was easy for us to go to and from Ayala, Cebu as it was just across the street.    Hotel staff and maintenance were friendly and professional.  Buffet breakfast was really nothing extraordinary..but just fine for what you pay. I would still look forward to staying in the same hotel in the future."
