Pacific Cebu Resort,"JOMADS\\for 27 years.  There is a cycle for their breakfasts. Ours was on a Monday so it was: Continental Filipino American.  Funny thing.. corned beef is in the American breakfast.  Oh sorry. No Canadian breakfasts. Haha.  The rooms were fine. The ""air con"" was strong and so was the hot water in the shower. No problem. OMG! There were a few ants. Hahaha. So what. It's the Philippines. They're everywhere.  The staff was courteous and friendly. I wouldn't hesitate to go back.  The door latch in room 505 needs to be reversed. It comes right off when you open the door.\\Tracey W\\we were there and the sea room villas that we were kindly moved to were lovely, we had everything we needed and they were very clean, just what we needed at the time. The food was good and reasonably priced and I can still say that after eating from the same menu for 3 weeks solid :) The pool bar and cocktails were fab and I am sure that had we visited at a different time we would have really enjoyed a few nights there. The staff here outshone some of the staff that we encountered in some 5* resorts, they went above and beyond at a time that was also difficult for them, thank you from the bottom of our hearts and We wish you all every success in the future xx\\jax70Manchester\\As we could not leave the resort this was very considerate, although it has to be said the food was not overpriced beforehand. With regards to the resort it was clean and tidy.   On our last week due to only 12 guests the management made the decision to move everyone to one block: an upgrade given free of charge. In the end there were only 8 guests left in the hotel.  We took the repatriation flight on the 7th April and the Manager Reynold arranged for the hotel bus to take us to the airport, free of charge.  The staff got up extra early (430am) to provide breakfast prior to our departure. Overall I cannot praise this resort enough.  All the staff were wonderful but a big shout out to Rey, Apple and Jay.\\Beth\\requested FO to change the linens as they doesn't look fresh. Additional amenities that you might add in the balcony which is really necessary after swimming is a drying rack. The drainage in the bath tub as well doesn't drain so easily. And you can check as well the doorknob since while we were there we had these connecting room and our room's doorknob doesn't lock; it didn't matter that much as the main door knob near the living room is locked. It's room 709. Nevertheless, I want these improvements to help you in making a better Pacific Cebu Resort, hence, I may come back since I had a nice stay! Thank you!\\serenegypsy\\number of certified diving instructors.  They have 2 restaurants, 4 pools and cabanas spread across the property. There's a very long pier that goes out to the sea. I think it's half kilometer with 4-5 hut stops if you want to rest.  The end of the pier is a snorkeling spot and a take off point for small boats. There is a small beach area fronting one of the pools. Everything is a sea of white against the sea and lush greeneries. This is a resort that you will be happy just taking in the view of the sea or the surroundings or just even your room.  At night the main pool, the pier and the walkways are strategically lighted up and club music is played across the grounds making the place look magical."
