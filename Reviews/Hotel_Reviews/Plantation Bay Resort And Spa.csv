Plantation Bay Resort And Spa,"Maia Celeste A\\If you’re planning to go to a resort in Cebu, DO NOT CHOOSE PLANTATION BAY. Bad, slow, inefficient  check in and check out. Service is bad. Dining options are limited, and the food is far from good. The water in the fake saltwater lagoon is dirty and itchy.\\Tour18606261730\\Water facilities/pools are nice. Rooms average. Check in/check out process inefficient and frustrating. Resto staff are not welcoming. More concerned about “audio sound levels of guests” than serving. Breakfast buffet is average.\\Patfancygirl\\The facilities are nice but the service is horrible. The restaurant staff were mot friendly or helpful.   The checkin & checkout process was inefficient, the staff unhelpful, and there were questionable charges. In the end we were billed for someone else’s room because the lady at the checkout counter made a mistake. And they didn’t make any attempt to correct it. We will never stay there again!\\Getaway57327402644\\Grandparents who are elderly had a leak in their room causing brown puddles in the floor or their room and brown water running down the wall. They were transferred to a different room only to have an unbearable smell of paint as they had placed them next to the pool being repainted, so the hotel teansferred them back to the room with brown puddles and they had to stay there for the night. Furthermore, we checking in as a group of 10, only to be told at the arrival of the restaurant on the hotel that we need 2 hours pre order and booking. We were not told this upon check in nor was it in any information leaflets given to us and of course we weren’t willing to wait two hours to eat. In addition, the large pool was closed with the diving rock and the salt water pool was dirty with\\TheLaagan\\This is our second time staying in Plantation Bay. First one was days prior to the wrath of  SuperTyphoon Odette. We're happy to see that the resort has slowly recovered from the damages the Typhoon caused. We are thankful to the staff for granting our request to have our room in the ground floor so it wouldn't be bothersome for my mom who is a senior citizen. The room is clean, spacious, and has the view of the big lagoon. Food is good. They have themed breakfast buffet and it was Chinese themed when we stayed there. So sad that I don't enjoy such food for breakfast. Luckily they have bacon and fruits. I hope they can consider offering a variety of food instead of a themed one. For snacks,  Route 66 offers delicious one. The resort is wide that an overnight stay is not enough\\サーシャ 安\\Water in sea, lagoons, and pools were warm as well as clean. Food was delicious and rooms were cleaned nicely. However, one employee really made our vacation bad. His name is Danny, and he wasn't nice to us. He refused to help, and said that we should solve the problem we had, by ourselves. Happily, other employee helped us soon. However, story with him didn't end. Afterwards, when we met him, he ignored us, and looked away when we greeted. That's why, we didn't enjoy our vacation as we wanted. In addition, at breakfast, variety of food was small compared to other hotels, and it wasn't worth the price we paid for it. It would've been great if there were more salads and food with meat or fish. That is what we felt.  Having said that, we had great time swimming and relaxing in\\Gracemon\\I never expected to have so much fun in an overnight stay. I usually tend to the kids and just relax in the room. This time I was fully outdoor and had as much time enjoying the facilities as everyone. The salt water pool was my fave! We will surely save up for another staycation at this resort.\\Joe M\\This was our 6th time staying at Plantation Bay. My wife and I even got married here in 2008. We love this resort but sadly we were disappointed with the lack of dining options this time.   On some nights there was only one restaurant open for fine dining and one restaurant for casual dining. Two restaurants for the size of that resort is inadequate.  And because our group was more than 4 people, the two fine dining restaurants require you to pay in advance for your food if you want to reserve a table. This policy is terribly inconvenient and unnecessary. You have to walk over to the restaurant hours before and order your food in advance and pay for it and then return hours later to eat it. I have traveled the world with my family and I never heard of this practice anywhere.  We\\Robert I\\Superior resort esp. for families: largest pools I have ever seen, most shallow enough for kids,  rooms in close proximity to the pools, the restaurants are excellent. Palermo offers authentic Italian cuisine; that place knows what it is doing.   I have stayed at Shangrila and Jpark but Plantation Bay offers more for the family at a slightly lower price.\\philipemail425\\We had a very late check in because our flight arrived at 1 AM and after Immigration and Customs, we finally got in the hotel at 3 AM. Unfortunately our room wasn’t ready eventhough it was already paid for. Fortunately the staff were very prompt in fixing the problem and management was also got involved and offered a resolution of the issue. Overall, our stay was very good. The staff were very attentive, the facilities were clean. We would definitely come back to stay here. We enjoyed our stay here and looking forward to come back. Thank you to all the staff who took care of us!\\Dennis P\\I have read a lot of bad reviews about this resort. I didn't expect to have firsthand bad experience. We were forced to booked another extra room just because my extra  4 and 6 years old kids were not free to stay. First time it happened to us. We've been many times to local resorts like shangrila, crimson, dusit and crimson but kids under 6 are free to stay.  All are very considerate and accomodating. Except them and there is something wrong here. This resort is not for family with small kids under 6 yrs old. I will rate our stay a 2⭐ for this. This is My opinion and based also from our experiences from the other resorts.\\Kirstin M\\Had stayed here multiple times because of the clean and  serene place but my most recent stay was not up to par. As always, staff were amazing and the lagoons are stunning. However, the room we had this time wasn't that clean. The floor is dirty (see photos), the first time I entered this room I walked barefoot just to not to leave dirt from my shoes but was surprised that the floor was dusty, it left the soles of my feet black. There were stains on the room and bathroom floor that could be wiped off with a damp cloth. This made me question about the cleanliness in the other parts of the room. :(  Weekend was very crowded with lots of unruly guests not minding social distancing, also don't know how they all fit in one room - that's what we get for a cheap rate I guess. Food in\\Micah C\\Amenities were in decent condition. Food was good. The best part was the staff. Staff are very friendly, accommodating, and patient. They are well trained and very polite. While there may have been a PR flunk recently, it has nothing to do with individuals who pour out their best efforts into creating a wonderful experience for their guests.\\Ram_B1969\\Our most recent stay was for 2 nights, 30th and 31st of December, meaning we had our New Year’s Eve at the resort. It’s one place that I assumed I could trust a New Year’s Eve with, and I wasn’t disappointed. We got the one-bedroom suite. We are a family of 3 adults. I think it was a perfect choice for this stay. Spacious room, really spacious bathroom, with tub, the room was just perfect. My online booking was also smooth, and checking in and out was smoother. We were granted early check-in and late checkout. We felt the same familiar Plantation Bay hospitality as how we experienced it before. Since the place was really big and wide with numerous choices and options for chilling or swimming, physical distancing with other people was easy. Biking around was fun. Looking at our\\Kakah Y\\The only reason why I would come back is because I feel bad for the staff who are cebuanos and are just really coming to work despite pandemic to make ends meet.   1. They told us we can get a room and pay extra person but on our way, they took it back and said we need to get another room for my nannies, which was fine bec I didnt come to beg and I can book them room. I just find this a deceitful act.  2. Two rooms booked, a long list of mostly DONTs yet they cant give us a decent room with an AC that’s working. They had to transfer us because it was busted.  3. TV was also broken! Haha what else can go wrong in this 5-star with so many rules yet failed to meet every expectation.  4. The worst- set breakfast was horrible. Sinangag station is waaaay better than you pay for 480\\Tikya V\\Don’t try to visit this place if your a filipino, because employees here are racist. They love to serve the Korean more than their own Kind. Very unhelpful. There are more beautiful places to stay in Cebu but Not here. Train your staff again of good manner and right conduct! Waste of time and money.\\Ginalyn G\\Place is beautiful but there’s employees who argued and have heated arguments around guests. Hardly anyone even smile. One even had sarcastic tone when asked about service schedule available. We got scolded by an employee for giggling during a funny incident while taking pictures.  We couldn’t wait to get out of there. Actually checked out a day earlier.\\E P\\Their lagoons has poor maintenance, the water is dirty, when I took a bath at one of their ""Lagoons"" my skin was irritated and became very itchy, the reason why I tried this place out was because it was expensive and I was expecting a 5 star experience out of my money but this place is really just ""main stream"" and nothing special out of it, you can find cheaper deals with better experience.\\Chekm8te\\Welp, I normally don't write reviews because I hop around a lot and don't have time to actually write a review.  These days, I'm not hopping around and experiencing a lot of places so I figured I'd write this review and it has been a while since I wrote one.  I've frequented this place since I started coming to Cebu for over a decade now.  I'd say I go almost once a year because I love their unique pools and atmosphere.  There were times (before the pandemic) that this place was booked for weeks and I couldn't get in.  Hated it but with things going on (2020), they are not as backlogged.  We decided to take the little one out to enjoy a pool away from home and I'm glad to see not much has changed.  A few upgrades that I've noticed actually that are pluses like the upgraded\\H Travels\\Every time I visit Cebu my local friends would always tell me to try staying at this resorts - so finally after years of always patronizing the same 5 star international hotel chain in the same island we wanted to give back and support the local businesses. Stating as a 5 star resort one would expect a minimum standard experience especially with its unique lagoon and amenities.   Overall the place still has some elements that held remnants of a great resort in the past but it’s now dilapidated old and just tired; like really tired - it’s definitely seen better days.\\Kurin Williams\\Very unbecoming of a resort. Rude and unfriendly staff. Resort staff kept on following us everywhere and we felt like we were being watched all the time.  This is the last time we're staying there. Book somewhere else and save yourself the headache.\\Mai P\\It could’ve been the perfect getaway for Fin, my child with special needs. When something excites him or when he is happy, he makes it known by squealing with delight. Fin is happy! That is what I always tell him every time he does that.  I thought that was okay until we were told from afar (a lifeguard). As a mother, your initial action would be directed to your child. So I told him not to squeal because it wasn’t allowed. Quite frankly it was a difficult moment. Another lifeguard came and told us the same thing. I had to explain that he is a child with needs. Every time Fin jumps in the water he’d be so happy that he’d laugh and squeals again. I tried hushing him and at one point tried to cover his mouth. But then I realized this is so wrong? This isn’t right at all! The plan\\Xxx\\Staff will approach you right away in the middle of your mobile call. You will surely feel deprived especially it was not written on the entrance or noted on tables or upon check in. No fun noise allowed.\\Michelle SC\\It was a great stay with you, Plantation Bay. As always, great staff and good food! My son and the entire family really enjoyed our stay with you. Although the air-conditioning in our room was not working well, you really fixed it that day (even it took you until night time). You even provided kits like alcohol, mask and gloves. Overall, it was nice and relaxing stay!\\MA R Fernandez\\We stayed here during our quarantine stay when we went home to the Philippines. We didn’t feel like we were quarantined at all because of the calm and peaceful environment of the place. It was a stress-free stay because the staff took care of all our needs, as well as the coordination with the appropriate agencies regarding our swab test results and airline concerns. Kudos to the General Manager, Mr Efren Belarmino, for a job well done!\\Carmen S. Araneta\\Because of the Covid pandemic, my flight from San Francisco to Manila was cancelled 4 times. Finally Philippine Airlines advised my July 3 flight was moved to July 4 & redirected to Cebu Province instead of Manila. Testing for Covid & hotel Quarantine would be in Lapu Lapu City, Cebu Province. At first I was hesitant due to the rise of Covid infections in Cebu City. I was scared but decided to push through. Having had 4 previous cancellations, my return flight was long overdue.   God be praised! My odyssey went very well. San Francisco Airport was eerily empty except for PAL counters. I landed safely at 4:30AM July 6 in Mactan Airport, Lapu Lapu City. Deplaned at 4:40 & was done with all - immigration & Covid testing by 5:10 a record 30 minutes! Mactan Airport had their systems\\Ronnel C\\We having a tour here, it was very comfortable. Swimming pools are wide and boat activity is cheap and fun. Restaurant good but no problem. I'm planing to stay this hotel soon to experience the activities.\\Roel\\Plantation Bay is one of our favorite short getaways! The lagoon right outside the room makes quite a difference in the experience so the ""Lagoon Side"" upgrade was well worth it! We loved going outside the room and immediately having access to the beautiful lagoon! At night, the live jazz music resonated around the resort. The staff were amazing and the food was great! Will definitely stay again!\\Glicel Ann P\\The amenities, activities and wide variety of swimming locations was superb! The Dive rock was a hit for my family. The staff were very pleasant, helpful and catered to our needs extremely well. The activity crew members were very very helpful during the snorkeling excursion and very nice to have all their hands on deck with snorkeling assistance, food and making sure we had a great time!\\SJH2702\\I have stayed at a number of resorts in Cebu but this is the best I have stayed at.  Approx 30-45 mins by car from the airport (depending on time of day & traffic) the facilities here are excellent & offer a great variety regardless of age.  There are a range of restaurants which offer good value for money, multiple swimming pools, plus beach & water activities to choose from.  The staff were excellent - special mention to Kathleen @ Kilimanjaro Kafé, Pia @ Palermo & Dan(iel) @ Swim-up Pool Bar - he is very entertaining.  On the subject of restaurants - I thoroughly enjoyed all the restaurants & the Themed Dinner was an experience of great food plus entertainment by the very talented staff."
