Radisson Blu Cebu,"neoveyuto\\We had a great time, friendly staff. The pool aren‚Äôt too hygienic guest doesn‚Äôt take shower before go to swim (must put a sign to take a shower first before swimming) The receptionist gave a wrong room key card during check-in and we are super tired from our long trip and can‚Äôt wait to rest. 8 out of 10. We are still super happy then.\\Fearless00427750912\\I travelled widely for business when I was working in Apple Computer for more than a decade, staying in 5- & 6- star hotels.  When I walked into Raddision on Tues 5 Sept I felt very good with the elegant and tasteful  interior design. Even the Filipino Ikebana stle flower arrangements everywhere.  I was particularly impressed with the restaurant super service-oriented attention and courtesy.  Paricularky how you trained tour restaurant service staff to be sooo good.  I dropped my breakfast even though out of 4 days I enjoyed 1 day of breakfast as I was very busy with business and leisuure easure eg whale sharks and waterfalls.  Half way my breakfast I wanted to give very good reviews & hence this very long reviews.   If I put excellent '5' peoe tend to think they are so good\\Otis_Jan\\Nothing else to say but amazing place to stay, hospitality is top notch and the service beyond expectation. The staffs were amazing, and the hotel is gorgeous. Loving the live music entertainment in the evening in the bar too, that was a bonus.\\I‚ù§Ô∏èbanff\\We stayed here for 4D/3N. The king bed was gigantic and very comfortable. The room was very clean. I personally picked this hotel for 2 main reason: 1. SM city is just next to the hotel. 2. I don‚Äôt want to ride a cab to take us shopping . Very accessible indeed to buy all your pasalubongs. We stayed here after our 3 1/2 week‚Äôs vacation mostly within the Visayas Islands.   We wanted to be well rested before our international flight.  We enjoyed our complimentary drinks while listening to the live music playing in the lobby/bar. Night swimming was also fun with our youngest.  Perfect to end the night. We heard the breakfast buffet was the best but we opt out coz we prefer to sleep in. We made reservations for dinner buffet instead and we were not disappointed, well except for the\\dmills332\\Central location for me, as I go to the office and other locations in Cebu and Mactan. I find having SM Mall next door super handy. The staff are always on hand to help out with requests, finding transpo etc.\\Anthony Huang\\Breakfast was delicious many choices but no mangoes in the fruit section.Theresa receptionist is attentive, entertaining and knowledgeable.She is a huge asset to your restaurant. We will definitely be back soon.   A fantastic experience and highly recommended.\\Johntxspud\\Hotel location was great. The location of the room given was next to the elevator foyer where we heard the constant elevator bells and people chatting. Some event had some heavy base that vibrated all the way up to the 14th floor from 8 pm to 6 am.\\JoeyBoyCalifornia\\This hotel sets the standards for all other hotels to aim for.  Clean, safe and have staff that are simply amazing.  Every encounter was pleasant and professional. The staff truly WANT to help their guests.  This is one of the best aspects of the Radisson Blu.  The staff want the guests to be comfortable and to have a pleasant stay; They will literally bend over backwards to make it the best experience.\\iowaloves2travel\\A very nice hotel. The room had a nice desk and they were able to get me an adaptor for my usa laptop. The restaurant had many options for both breakfast and lunch. The bed was firm and the pillows were soft. My room had a walk in shower. The room was musty smelling would be the only downside. The hotel is right next to the mall very easy to walk across the street.\\Ann Carmel M\\Stayed and dined and is always a wonderful experience.

Supposed to have an amazing stay BUT when we checked out the concierge did not assist in opening the door to the exit seeing that I had heavy bags in both hands.\\stevewestcliff\\Great stay and marvellous hotel. Great staff and nice pool. The only issue were the bed sheets were a little itchy but maybe over starched as they were so clean. The pool was lovely and the room attendant amazing. The check in staff brilliant.\\Densyorn27\\The experience that my family had in staying at the Radisson Blu hotel was phenomenal. The facility is clean and top notched and the staff is was beyond exceptional. In my opinion, you get the best value at the best location in Cebu City.

You guys are awesome, thank you so much for this wonderful experience, we will come back there for sure.\\gce909\\Excellent hotel with great breakfast and diner buffet.

Upon booking, they charge local tax and estimated tax after you placed the credit details for booking confirmation  2.) Upon checkin, they let you wait 45mins in the queue 3.) WHEN ITS YOUR TURN, they will tell yoy, there‚Äôs no room available  4.) They then let you wait 1hr and 45 mins for yoy to go in. 5.) Pillows were bad.\\Passport39226059828\\Walking through the lobby I was immediately impressed. The service at the front desk was very professional and the room i was given was very comfortable. The food at the buffet everyday was always excellent.\\KritzR3\\Recommendations:  Provide ‚Äòdo not disturb‚Äô door knob hanger for guests privacy concerns. Additional daily unique dish for breakfast buffet, with consideration for guest with multiple night stay at the hotel.\\malianfa\\I love my short stay in your hotel and I enjoyed your amazing service. Your personnel are courteous and hospitable. The rate of your hotel is affordable and your ammenities are excellent. Your facilities are well maintained by your hardwoking staff.\\Mirasol M\\Grace Salazar highly recommended us to stay at Radisson Blu. The service was excellent, Girlie took control of our booking and accommodated all our needs in our room. And then Alexine at the buffet treated us like royalty where she surprised us with fruit and a cake in honor of celebrating my husband‚Äôs retirement! I highly recommend Radisson to anyone that is staying or visiting Cebu Philippines. Amenities and customer service was outstanding!\\larryhockaday1984\\Customer service was amazing. I stayed for 3 weeks and had no problems. The mall was across the street. Security was friendly and I felt safe. The pool bar employees remember my orders and engaged in small talk.\\michael m\\I cannot praise Radisson Hotel enough for their remarkable dining experience. The food options were diverse, and each dish was crafted with precision and creativity. The flavors were exquisite, and the presentation was a feast for the eyes. The hotel's commitment to exceptional service was epitomized by Kyle, whose attentiveness and friendly demeanor left a lasting impression. Not only that but also Fhel, Jean (reception) for her genuine passion for hospitality and dedication to ensuring guests' satisfaction added an extra layer of enjoyment to my dining experience"
