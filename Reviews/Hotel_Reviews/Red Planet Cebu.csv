Red Planet Cebu,"Brianberger\\small rooms but very comfortable bed and nice hot shower i will book  again next year for longer stay nice to have a 711 downstairs and ayala mall is only one block away the mall is big and has lots of choices for food\\Vincent P\\Good value for money stay in a great location. Staff are very accomodating and efficient. Rooms are clean and compact which is perfect for work trips. The wifi maybe spotty at times and need to be upgraded.\\Grace G\\Amazing location! The hotel is situated in the city proper and is very close to Starbucks (opens 6:30am-12mn) and malls (Ayala mall, Metro, and Rustan's). 7-11(convenience store) is located at the ground floor of the hotel and is open 24hrs. The guards are very friendly and so was every other staff at the hotel. They have ample parking space and it's clean. This is also where the smoking area is located. It's easy to travel from the hotel to any part of Cebu city whether thru taxi, motorcycle, or PUV. The water pressure is really nice. The wifi works and is fast. Their lobby is kinda small but cozy and clean.\\ryanazuro\\Don't missed the opportunity to check-in at Red Planet Cebu. Where the center of all amenities in the city.

Good ambiance. Cool aircon. Nice architectural. Superb staff.from ground floor, parking to receptionist to housekeeping. Good view of the tall buildings in the vicinity. Walking distance Metro and Ayala malls.\\giuliodH4485HG\\Quality, clean, comfortable--from entering the building, the lift, hallway, up to the room. Truly a great value for your $$$.  Food is not a problem because there are lots of good restaurants outside with just a quick stroll away. Transportation is not a problem either. I was given a 4th floor room and the window has a nice view of night lights and tall nearby buildings.\\guilarue1990\\Perfect 2 nights with nice staff and when needed to extend our stay thr staff made it easy and quick and hassle free. Really enjoyable stay and room was really nice and clean. I limed that we are in control of when we want our room to be clean.\\Vicky\\This place has a great location. Their staff are very friendly and accommodating. I arrived too early before check-in time and I was a bit surprised when they told me that my room is ready. I got an early check in free of charge, and I didn’t even have to ask for it.Thank you very much. I would surely stay here again.\\Michelle A.\\Everything! I have stayed in various Red Planet locations and most of the time they have exceeded my expectations. Same for this stay because the location, amenities, cleanliness, and value for money were all excellent.  I would also like to commend the staff because they were extremely helpful and went beyond expectations, especially Charish at the front desk! She helped us find a nice transport service from Cebu City to Moalboal after almost being scammed by a GrabCar driver.  I will definitely stay in Red Planet Cebu when I am back in the city!\\Julian Q\\Stayed here for 3nights and it’s well maintained. Very clean and simple not bad for a 2 star hotel. The good thing here is its very near in ayala mall just walking distance. Staff’s are mababait :) I recommend this to those travellers solo, friends or family :)\\Go21623383376\\this was my first time at the red planet hotel in Cebu City. It was an outstanding experience and I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody that visits Cebu City. You are definitely not be disappointed\\HeartyMixNutriClub\\Comfy place to stay. Towel is big and clean. Bed is just enough, linens are clean, generally the room is nice. The only thing i dont like guard below the belong not friendly and it difficult to park to go down from car\\Alvin\\Strategic location near the Ayala Mall Cebu and the environs. Quiet room is good located at the back side of the hotel. Internet connections terribly slow, friendly staff and security personnel. But relatively expensive for a good value hotel compare to other local hotel chains.\\Ray\\got a clean room and good valueable place to stay , and got really polite and friendly receptionist ever, this hotel also provide you wifi , and internet corner to use , good for business trip,got a convinience store beside\\kberna868078\\the room is clean, as well as the bathroom. comfortable bed. strong wifi and aircon. very nice place to stay with good service and staffs. will surely book again when I go home to the Philippines soon.\\Explore780638\\I love it. Approachable Receptionist:) Friendly guard very helpful staffs :) I love the bed and the fragrance. Great value of money :) Make sure to register on their website to get a very cheap price. I love my stay :)\\Gordon K\\Very clean, good beds, good linens, good locations, parking, lots of hot water in clean showers. They cover all the basic requirements very well and keep the room sizes on the smaller end so they keep the price down\\BPFerreira\\I stayed in this hotel after traveling around Cebu Island on my own. The hotel is perfect for a short or long stay. Rooms are a good size for one person, but they might get a bit small for a couple. The water pressure was excellent and the bed was extremely comfortable. Internet works perfectly.\\Brijraj S\\Professional business budget hotel. No frills are provided. Their methods are new but practical and if very low price but good value is what you need....  choose Red Planet. Located opposite Ayala mall so lots to do in the free time.\\kcsant0s\\I will recommend Red Planet Hotel-Cebu to my friends who are going to Cebu. It was a good overnight experience in the hotel. Was able to go quickly to Ayala mall. I wish breakfast was served within the hotel :)\\Marc Ian O\\I stayed here 2 nights. And it was a memorable experience. The place is near to Ayala Mall and few minutes from the Airport. There is a convenience store just a few steps away for an easy snacks and needs. Staff are very friendly and professional. They will attend to you promptly with courtesy. There is also a covered parking space. I will definitely visit again this place.\\Girley B\\The first Red Planet Hotel I stayed was RP Aseana and since then, wherever I go, I always choose this hotel. The rooms are small but enough for me, but I like the double bed, clean sheets, huge toilet, clean room, courteous and friendly staff.\\FrequentFlier11295\\Coveniently located (close to Ayala), effecient & professional service, & wallet-friendly price. had a pleasant stay. The only thing I don't like is this review requires a minimum of 2020 characters..\\artogle\\Good location, clean rooms, clean linens, reasonable price, excellent staff! Near my office, and the mall.   Everything inside the room is white, white linens, white bathroom, depicting cleanliness.  Reasonably priced.  All the staff are approachable, accomodating, helpful.\\cesargalleno\\when you enter to your room you will amaze since its very clean and  have a comfortable beds to sleep, then  the amenities are also good. The location is easy to locate and its near in a department store.\\John\\Paid ~PHP6,100 for 3nights in mid-July 2018.   Just the bare essentials in the room but clean.  Central enough location to Cebu City and Mandaue City although a bit far from Lapu-Lapu City.  Easy enough to get a GrabCar.  If you have your own car, they have free on-site parking with security guard - ask him to help direct traffic if you're having difficulty merging - don't forget to tip!\\MayMay1222\\The place was so nice and the service was excellent. Truly a good place to stay especially it was located in the heart of the city. And also, what I like most is the security. You will never worry about being harmed because of their unique security that I never experienced in other hotels."
