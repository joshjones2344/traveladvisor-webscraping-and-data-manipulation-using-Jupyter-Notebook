Savoy Hotel Mactan Newtown,"Iriquois P\\ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE.   First: they told us check-in is at 3pm even if our booking information from them says it‚Äôs at 2pm  Second: throw pillows smell so bad  Third: our air-conditioning is busted. We told the housekeep but they had no idea. They didn‚Äôt even had the initiative to ask the proper department. We had to be the ones to call. And we waited for waaaaay too long. Also, when we checked in we just thought to give the air-conditioning a bit of time, but after 2 hours with the setting at 18 deg / cool mode / full fan still nothing.\\candice marie enciso\\Savoy Mactan is the BEST HOTEL TO HAVE YOUR QUARANTINE. Why? While I was still in Norway I called them and requested a room with a view since it will be a quarantine stay to keep my sanity and they did gave me a nice room with a mactan view. From the airport, their shuttle van is very friendly and accomodating. Shout out to Kristian and Jasher who welcomed me and took care of my bags. I paid only around 600php but itbwas worth it. And the receptionists are very friendly. My husband managed to coordinate with them to arranged a surprise welcome flowers and cake to my room. Thank you so much.   The food service crew always grant me my order and the side ordersüòåüòÄ Overall stay is EXCELLENT.   Special thank to my friend who made this booking for me. Savoy Boracay coordinated this\\byahenijay\\One of my favorite staycation place in Mactan Island Philippines. A well managed business hotel with beach access, parking, 24/7 in room dining, service transfers, beautiful and kind Sales Team thanks to Ms Ginafe Casas for always putting the Savoy brand into first class service standards. Thanks also to the pool bar service attendants for the friendliest service provided during our stay. Excellent job Savoy Mactan Team!\\SharmilaDrews\\Had a pleasant stay here. New Hotel. Checked in at 4pm but was able to check in at 5pm. Frustrating but it was a weekend. Still, the staff are courteous and gave us excellent service. Breakfast is also busy but they never ran out of food. Lattes are complimentary and you can order it from the bar.\\Ben W\\This hotel is value for your money  Busy hotel and breakfast could be improved coffee is terrible  swimming pool is nice user friendly   Close to many restaurants and food outlets  Taxi and grab easily accessible  Room staff excellent  Reception staff need more training in how to deal with the public not an easy job but professionals handle with ease\\Han C\\There were roaches in thr bathroom. Housekeeping forgot to clean our room even though we had the service light on. Breakfast buffet is a bit underwhelming and sometimes there's a long wait due to availability of tables. There is hardly any space in the rooms to place your belongings as there is a small tv stand in place of a table that most hotels have. I wouldnt stay here again and I am shocked that this hotel won some sort of travelers choice award.\\byahenijay\\One of the best hotelin Mactan Island interms of quality service this hotel didnt fail me in giving the 5 stars service from the heart from Sales , reservations, transfers to food and beverage headed by Ginafe thank you very much for the efficient service  as always oneof my favorite hotel in Mactan.  Till next visit thank you Savoy Mactan.\\Kareen V\\I stayed the night with my family for the first time at this hotel and location. The location was excellent; there are many nice restaurants and shops around. Which is what I always take into consideration while looking for a hotel. The 2 rooms we booked was amazing, so cozy and clean. This exceeded my expectations when I arrived, and it was well worth the amount we spent. Although we had a problem with the key card when we returned to our room after breakfast, but Dominic was fantastic in assisting us. Overall, we had a great time during our stay at Savoy Hotel Mactan. We will most certainly return and even recommend it to our friends.\\Mndwrkz\\4 out of 5. The Manager was kind enough to upgrade our room. The only downside is, it took so long for someone to answer the phone and for someone to deliver ice to our room. Will need to call twice to follow-up our order. I understand maybe they are understaffed. Overall our experience is superb, and will definitely visit again!\\Koko loko kim\\This is the worst hotel We‚Äôve ever been, You‚Äôd expect this place to have a 5 star service of what you payed for but it‚Äôs far from that We checked in 2pm but unfortunately they said there is no room available so we have to wait got back 5pm  Still no room available  Finally 6pm  First room was hot as hell aircon didn‚Äôt work So asked for a room transferred  The 2nd room stinks and dusty So me and my partner decided to just upgrade our room from deluxe to junior suite!  Next day my mother in law arrived she‚Äôs in town for a day and when we did her checked in 3pm  We have to wait till 8pm just to get her room lucky we were there if not she‚Äôll be with the rest of the guests that got their room late take note didn‚Äôt just happened to me but also a lot of people  During check out time we\\Lex O\\I was told by my friends about the promo's of Savoy Hotel and avail one of those. My experience was kinda fun and memorable. As we entered we were greeted politely by the guard with a smile, the FOA also greeted us and approach us right away, we were asked by our IDs pleasantly and check in us smoothly. All employees were approachable and very accommodating. The rooms were clean and smells good as we enter. The foods also was delicious and mouthwatering. Thank you so much Savoy for making our stay a good one and memorable ‚ô•Ô∏è\\Scarlett\\My experience at Savoy Hotel Mactan was worth satisfying, the employees was very accommodating and friendly especially the front office associates they are very polite and hospitable, the check in was very smooth and no hustle. The rooms was worth for its price and not just that, the food also that they serves and offer was delicious and worth the price ‚ô•Ô∏è Thank you so much for the good service, hope to visit again soon‚ú®\\ChrisA.\\It was indeed a tiring yet fruitful experience travelling to North Cebu & Bohol so my partner and I decided to look for a hotel nearby the airport to enjoy our remaining days in this beautiful province and we saw Savoy- it wasnt our first time staying in this excellent hotel but our first time in Savoy Cebu. The lobby sets our first impressions that staffs here are very hospitable and we were correct from their Front Office staff- Eilyn to the room service attendants are all hospitable with a smile on their faces. Moving to their rooms, it was spacious and provided an adequate space for people who are working remotely like us- all our new and sets on its place. Bathroom is well equipped with beyond the normal set-up vs other hotels with the same class. Food is ultimately okay\\Bliss2023\\We stayed here for 2 nights whilst passing through Cebu and although the hotel has potential, we weren‚Äôt sad to leave. On our way up the lift, we noticed a certain ‚Äòmusty‚Äô smell which only worsened as we got into our room. Soon noticed that around the sink in the bathroom, was a ring of mould just u set the counter top and realised that the over powering smell we could smell was mould. We asked reception if we could move which they readily did for us and although the next room was much better, it still had the same issue. The breakfast was average and we ended up eating out during the evenings but for a passing through hotel, it was okay.\\Khimla B\\The front office is very friendly, smooth transaction. They are very friendly and very accommodating. When we arrived at the hotel they are already smiling at us and greeted us good afternoon right away. The room is very clean and beautiful.\\michelle z\\i stayed for one night upon checking where to stay at the last minute. i was not disappointed at all.. the check in was smooth by front desk staff Mitch and concierge Kristian Monton. they were accommodating and made me feel welcome.  even the guards on duty were very corteous in greeting too.  the location of the restaurants, supermarket, massage, church, convenient stores and starbucks are just walking distance. would love to stay here again!\\Joy G\\I stayed for 6 days and so far i had an awesome experience! Thank you Savoy for making my stay an extra comfortable as i travelled with my 23 month old toddler! The food was awesome and even rooms are quite big! (Stayed in junior suite)  Will definitely be back soon!\\Ophichius Lowis G\\The service was really good. The transaction was really smoother than I expected. The best part is the FOA, which very accommodating. They won't leave you unless you are already comfortable. They treat me like a VIP, they surpass my expectation about check-in in this Hotel. The experience stay in the Hotel is satisfying.   Thank you for the accommodation. Definitely, will come back!\\Kaisserstuff\\The stay in Savoy Mactan was excellent! We were welcomed with excellent, gorgeous and super delicious Cebuano local delicacies and menus.   The rooms are so clean and relaxing, there's a Gym, Pool and Mini-Bar. We enjoyed a lot our stay in Savoy and Cebu as well.\\Lou Gilward\\I really appreciate the Hotel's front desk for giving us a smooth and early check in unlike the other hotels out there the staff are really humble and approachable. My partner and I personaly enjoyed the welcome drink after a heavy traffic it is really resfreshing to be greeted with a refreshement. also, the room is clean cozy and comfy, Our hotel's experience is great and wonderful, might check in back soon üòäüòäüòä\\clamster\\Firstly I must say just how helpful, polite and efficient all of the staff were at the Savoy.  They made myself and my partner feel valued and comfortable.  I have no basis to complain about any of the core issues at this hotel. Room service, housekeeping, cleanliness and covid awareness were all top notch. The swimming pool was clean and a nice temperature and the towel service easy. Our room, on the 8th floor, was roomy and the bed comfortable.   The only area where I feel an improvement could be made was breakfast. It was rather strange in its offer. I appreciate that this is the Philippines,  but , unless requested there was no tea on offer, only ready brewed coffee. Personally I always drink tea with breakfast.  Then there were the cups. Very small to say the least.  The\\Jay Escultor\\5 STAR - GOOD HOTEL to stay  I was stressed from heavy traffic in Manila but here in Mactan, I was mesmerized with white beach of Mactan Newtown though was slightly damaged by Odette. Your staff was very active on my requests.  The room is clean and their pool has the best spot for insta-worthy posts. Thank you for wonderful experience in your hotel. Will recommend this to my collegues\\kenjee08072014\\Title : They have best service ever!  I know myself to have a lot of requests just to make myself happy especially on having staycation after my busy schedules. The food was superb and their batalla de Mactan? That was worth a try!!!!  Can‚Äôt wait to try another batalla next month and avail their promo ! ahahhaahhahahahaha .. Thank you very much for indulging me with good food and new spot to vacay in Mactan!  Keep it up!\\GraceF\\We stayed at SAVOY Hotel Mactan Newtown for 3 days and 2 nights last March 2-4. For us, this is the BEST Hotel in Mactan or even in Cebu! The way they maintain the cleanliness of the hotel is very impressive! One thing we will never forget are the accomodating and friendly staff, everytime we pass by them, they always greeted us with a nod and a smile, that's what we love most!   SAVOY Hotel Mactan Newtown is perfect for whatever ocassion you'll celebrate.   Plus, I am a GYM MEMBER since October 2021 and now I'm extending my MEMBERSHIP to SIX MONTHS üíû That's how I am pleased and satisfied with their accomodation.  It's always great in Savoy Hotel Mactan Newtown ‚ú®üíû\\LLOYD M\\I'm so pisssed with this hotel, been here for almost a week thinking that being in your home country will give you better service versus their foreign counterparts. Yes the room is cozy good view but cleanliness hell no the bath room has hairs from the previous occupants, toilet bowl dirty (attaching some photos). Pricing of their menu is far high than surrounding restaurants, a classic example is their egg= $1, pizza $12.44, tapsilog $7.44! Truly a rip-off jo wonder so many bad reviews about this hotel.   This review is to improve the quality of service of the hotel.  So odd can't upload the pictures.\\Brahdd S\\Best hotel for your Quarantine. Staffs are  accommodating.  Especially Engineering and Housekeeping Department. If there are any concern,they can  accomodate directly. Thanks to DEAN,ART and Ritchelle for the effort..\\Dieu H\\A ruin experience on our first visit in Cebu! But the hotel made up with an unexpected service recovery in what we describe a total renew experience in Savoy. Frankly speaking, we didn‚Äôt expect such a kind gesture from the GM. We just wanted to share our mixed experience to the Outlet Manager, but it turns out to be the GM who handled us. Everything was dealt with professionally obviously! That is all we really wanted and you have successfully converted us to be your new loyal advocate. 10/10 recovery and kudos to the GM and entire team.\\reli f\\I highly recommend to stay with the savoy hotel either for leisure or business type of a visit. We are very pleased not just the location but also the staff, we stayed for over 3 weeks to this hotel and I can tell how lucky the company to have a genuine and kind staff. They‚Äôre very welcoming and you can feel that they treat their client with respect and fairly, I would like to thank all of the staff for their hard work and doesn‚Äôt look/base their treatment to all their client by what they wear or where they‚Äôre coming from (nationality). It makes us feel like home when we stayed to this hotel. Thank you and looking forward to stay with savoy in the future.\\Maria\\During our stay, the pool was under maintenance. We felt like we were quarantined guests coz there is nothing to do in this hotel. Their parking and hallways stinks coz i think their septik tank was under maintenance too. We were about to leave the hotel during the day of check in but was tired to go back home. What disappoints me is their covid safety protocol. On the night of our checked in, we were already 5 inside the elevator when the guard stopped to open the elevator to let the newly arrived OFW go with us. Luckily, the lady in our elevator said 'My God we are already full. You're not practicing the protocol' so the guard decided to let the OFW stepped out and wait for the other elevator.  During the night, aircon got humid. Their bathroom is so mall . Breakfast is just\\Chrislyn O\\This is our 2nd time coming for the Batalla Splash, and its always a feast! It's cheap for its variety and taste. Perfect combination of Filipino dishes including the lechon kawali, grilled bangus and other seafood.   Plus, we get to enjoy the pool with our kids. üòç"
