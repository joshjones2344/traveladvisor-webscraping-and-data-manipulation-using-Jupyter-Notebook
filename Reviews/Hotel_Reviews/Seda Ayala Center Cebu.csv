Seda Ayala Center Cebu,"Christian C\\One of the most comfortable hotel I’ve ever stayed. Best Bed and Pillow for me. Hirap bumangon sa sobrang lambot ng kama at unan. Kudos also to all their hospitable and very accommodating employees especially to the Hosekeeping and Restaurant team.  Special Mention to June and Justin of Housekeeping Team and Jegger, Manager of the Misto Restaurant.  Thank you, Seda Ayala Cebu for this once in a lifetime experience.\\maryjaynechristineu\\All of the staff are accommodating with smiles on their face. The Food for breakfast is good.

Location is ideal and accessible to the mall and public transport. Restaurant staff and Front of House team are very helpful and friendly. The cleaning crew is thorough.  Overall - will definitely back once we visit Cebu city again.\\pallegumaraojr\\We arrived past 10pm and our room was still reserved for us. The room was spacious and very cozy. There have been no problems during our stay. We were just there for a night, but we had a good time. The buffet was lovely as well. Can't wait for our nexr stay.\\adal\\Seda Ayala Centre Cebu is ideally located adjacent to the mall. Airport transfer was prompt and comfortable. Despite some online reservation hiccups, check-in was speedy since Gia at Front Desk quickly resolved the problem. Prior email arrangements with Misto Assistant Manager Adonis for lunch and dinner assured my group of a lovely and pleasurable dining experience. Angelica made sure we enjoyed our pasta and pizza buffet lunch which was quite interesting. We also got excellent menu recommendations from Camille who assisted my group of ten at dinner and everyone loved the a la carte dishes as well as her efficiency kind attention to detail. Breakfast buffet had the crispiest bacon, the freshest fruit, and a variety of dishes to relish.  It was a very relaxing and hassle-free\\Cliff C\\The hotel's staff were wearing smile and polite all the time and gave me a lot of support when I needed. the room was clean and cozy, but noise seemed easily transparent from the one next door.   Gym equipment is maintained well, despite they had been used for years.  Besides that, this hotel is really recommended for the food, ambience, staffs, pool and pool side bar, and most importance is the location and even easy access to Ayala mall .\\gerarduy2023\\very good service, satisfied, nice place to stay. airport and hotel transfer very prompt. no waiting time. we will definitely come back next time we visit cebu.  highly recommended.. same as your other affiliate hotels here in Metro Manila\\Stay358177\\Our stay in the hotel was above expectations. The staff and crew were very pleasant and courteous enough to interact with. Rooms and amenities were pretty clean and convenient. Overall, our experience here in Seda Ayala Center Cebu was very good.\\Gregg F\\Stopped in after a week of business travel for some relaxation.  The hotel is located in the heart of Cebu City next to a very nice mall. Firstly, the staff is really nice and helpful here. The ladies at the front desk helped us multiple times with finding places and making dinner reservations. The hotel is older with faded carpet, but is still quite nice and very clean. The best part is the room air conditioning works great and doesn’t turn off in the middle of the night like some other hotels.  When going into the Club Lounge, Mary was always there with a big smile and offered a little chit chat asking how the day went or how dinner was.  As a traveler with elite status at multiple hotel chains, I always appreciate that personal touch like remembering my name and the things I\\Apple T\\Thanks to Christopher Crisologo for arranging a birthday cake. He is very professional in dealing guests needs. Marlo during bfast was very attentive,Nica, Karen at the front desk very efficient. Front desk staffforgot the name who extended our LCO was flexible.\\Jess S\\Stayed here twice on separate occasions during our recent holiday in Cebu. Staff were very friendly throughout the duration of both our stays. Front desk helped organised late check out and airport transfer, both reasonably priced. Location is fantastic, only a  5min walk to Ayala mall and the many restaurant options. Pool was ok, smaller than what we expected. Breakfast buffet was great, lots of options to choose from. Note need to go before 8am to avoid the rush otherwise will need to wait for a table. Beds are comfortable. Rooms are reasonably clean however the bathrooms could use a deep clean, visible mould in the shower, basin, bidet hose, and rusty garbage bin. There is a mini fridge in the rooms however they didn’t get very cold even after trying to adjust the settings.\\theflyingtrainer\\The good. Great location. Right beside a good mall. In the mornings, you can walk/jog around the mall garden. Appetizing breakfast buffet. Friendly staff. Clean rooms.  The bad. Conference room projectors are blurry.\\P.M.\\First and foremost - The staff of Seda - from security to reception to housekeeping to maintenance to the Misto Restaurant have all been exceptional!  Smiles and greetings everyday!  We stayed long term (two weeks) - I normally try to book directly with hotels, but the Seda price was $2,976 (AUD) - so I ended up booking through Agoda for $2,283 (AUD) - a saving of $700 (AUD).  We stayed in room 429 - with a view of the street front of the hotel just over the roof line of the entry.  (Last year in November we stayed for 3 nights on the 6th floor with a view of the Ayala Center Terraces and it was a great view especially since Ayala was decorated for Christmas).  It would have been nice to have a room on the Ayala side since we were staying so long, but probably ended up on the\\janethharvey\\This was our first stay at the Seda brand, although we have stayed at this location when it was a Marriott.  We were quite  impressed with the quality of the rooms, the polite and very attentive staff, food, value, and overall atmosphere of this excellent hotel.  The hotel's proximity to an excellent mall, variety of food offerings, and atmosphere, were all excellent.  We look forward to our return trips.\\Cindy T\\The service is great - efficient staff esp at the buffet room, in particular staff named Ivy and Angeline!  Our room is always nicely made up by our cleaners Rafgi and Julu! Food needs improvement though.    The congee is inconsistent, sometimes watery n sometimes thick.  There need to be a better toaster for breads that couldn't fit on slice bread slots. Attended the Seafood Friday, the service catering on servicing the lobster  was not only slow, it was chaotic such that our individual lobsters got mixed up at our table, some of which we didn't even order!  And the lobsters were not fresh - they were mushy rather than tangy.  Orange juice was too watered down.\\Excursion12625727268\\Really nice hotel. The breakfast and dinner buffets were amazing, especially the seafood buffet on Friday’s. Special mention to Angelica on the day shift in the restaurant. Very friendly and made me feel very welcome.\\ysilk85\\It was so nice as a hotel located next to Ayala Mall, shopping and dining were so convenient, and the hotel breakfast was satisfactory. I was impressed by the fact that the staff were friendly and tried to help.\\HmDePerio\\I have always love seda. Theres no question to it. I know i always get a good sleep at seda. Clean sheets and towels.  The staff were very courteous and friendly. Although some needs to greet and acknowledge the guest at all time. For the past two weeks of my trip i have been to few hotels and greeting a guest on the hallways or anywhere in the establishment is a plus.\\Carsten R\\As always when we travel to the Philippines we stay at Seda Ayala Center Cebu. We stayed in a Junior Suite, which had a small anteroom with a sofa, table, closet and TV. I knew this suite and everything was as expected. When making the reservation I had ordered an extra bed, this was shown on the reservation with a one-time 2,000 peso. In the hotel I should pay this amount then daily, we have then waived it and used the sofa as a sleeping accommodation.  The room cleaning was sometimes very slow, we have made with the employee partly a cleaning appointment, which was then also times not kept. We also had to call after the room cleaning because the soap or toilet paper was not refilled.   We had booked the room with breakfast, the rich breakfast internationally oriented and\\anamhipolito24\\Location is superb. Staff are great. Easy to deal with and guests were well taken care of with simple requests,even there are lots of guests during our  stay.we will consider to stay here again.i just hope the lobby will ne more modern feels  just like here in manila.pls replace the  bathroom towels with new one.i think its too old to use.\\RetiredLEOPCSO\\The location of this hotel makes it great for travelers, who do not want to travel far to find decent food. The DJ near the pool every evening add some ambience. The employees are always kind in engaging with visitors. The breakfast is better than most the hotel is getting Older but it’s still comfortable and clean generally.\\Orly D\\I have been staying at this property for many years now even before it became SEDA. It is a very convenient place being just beside a mall and highly secure, the kind most travelers are looking for in a hotel.\\pattidapitan\\Overall my review is great,  room is always made by Ericson (our attendant) my check in was prompt thru the help of Stephen.  The whole housekeeping team under the supervision of Darvey Demicillo was excellent.  I can't thank everybody enough, it made my stay a very pleasant 3 days.\\rvt1988\\One of the better Seda Hotels. Very clean and comfortable rooms. The couch in our room is soft and the pillows are very soft. Quality and variety of breakfast food is also excellent. Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends.\\Kathy T\\What can I say about Seda Ayala Center Cebu and Seda IT Bloc. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay safe and stress free. We've enjoyed everyone hospitality and the securities made us feel valued. The people in Seda are beautiful and kind. I would recommend anyone to consider staying here. It has all the amenities since the mall is right next door. Thank you, Seda for the warm and amazing stay!\\indiana712023\\The junior is very basic and bland. No iron and bathroom door won’t close. The toiletries provided were too tiny. The closet had no iron and was open with no cover. It did not look like a four star hotel room.  The staff were very courteous and nice!\\F. Scott\\As much as I wanted to give a perfect score, I decided not to because I believe that there’s always a room for improvement.  This used to Marriot hotel and I stayed once before with my husband. I tried to refresh my memory on comparing everything. But i guess, there’s only a couple of things that’s make it different. Anyway, I would like to applaud all the staff for doing their job so well. They are very friendly, accommodating, hospitable, courteous, respectful and very warm. The location of this hotel is very accessible and it’s very safe. The buffet was really good. Overall, this hotel is a great place to stay. Truly, great staff and great service…\\elginleon\\Not the hotels fault but we stayed in the gumamela room for several hours due to availability, but when we were checked in everything was perfect, the staff was friendly and accommodating, keep it up guys!! Y’all are the best!!\\Trex1887\\Our experience in SEDA Ayala Cebu is very good. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. The room is very comfortable and connectivity is fast. The location of the hotel is just right for us to experience Cebu City. The overall experience is very satisfactory."
