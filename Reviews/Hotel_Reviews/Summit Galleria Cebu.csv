Summit Galleria Cebu,"Ana-Maria\\I have never been attended in my entire life, anywhere I've ever travelled, in such a wonderful, attentive way. The staff is amazing! From what I can remember (I'm bad with names), stand out Albert, Jun, Sam, Gisele (she made my day every morning at breakfast) and Ruby. Thank you all for a wonderful stay.\\Tegwyn S\\Thank you to Beth, Giselle and Jane for your friendly efficient service and lovely smiles making our breakfast very relaxing as well as delicious.  Really great to have breakfast included with accomodation especially when travelling with a 3yr old.  Special thanks to Wensley for the delicious specially made scrambled eggs and an omelette!\\jel mark e\\Nice hotel, food and services at the cafe. The hotel is also friendly for the senior citizens and persons with disability. The menu are good also. First timers will be definitely satisfied with the overall services of summit galleria hotel.\\Odyssey56047745898\\From the lobby, cafe summit, hallway and the hotel room- aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. Sophisticated and elegant but reasonably priced hotel.   Big room, clean, spacious, well lighted with modern design/theme. Although, bathroom fixtures maybe improved.   Breakfast offering/selection was above average. I felt the food was prepared with love because they were all tasty. The ham with mango glazed and spanish style bangus were delicious. The cafe ambience is class and relaxing and may I say comforting, as there is a positive feeling evoked to start the day.  Beth is attentive but not intruding. Her smile is warm, shy but sincere.   A pleasant stay indeed.\\Chris R\\We had our meal at cafe summit and the service was amazing. We are thankful for Jun for catering to our needs especially since we were dining with our little kids. Thanks Jun! You made our time a pleasant oneüòä\\Rick G\\I mostly enjoyed the restaurant, I am a very low-key person and prefer to stay in the shadows.  One waiter I'm extremely appreciative of is Sam...he initiated me with small talk, and went way beyond to make sure I was happy.  I have my laptop and am vacationing solo.  When I came downstairs to get table the other watress tell me no on bigger table.  He pushed 2 tables together to accommodate my breakfast and laptop...man! Extremely appreciative. thx üòÅ\\Norberto A\\Great service V√®ry efficient The people there are very respectful/courteous/friendly and would initiate/attentive to meet your needs.

Will definitely recommend to my friends and relatives!\\Albert Chan Paran\\Summit Galleria Cebu is my 16th City Hotel since I started my Hotel-Resort-Farm Staycations in Christmas 2020 up to the whole year 2021. For the past 6 years every time I traveled to Robinsons Galleria Cebu for shopping, dining, and watching movies, I already have Summit Hotels and Resorts on my bucket list. When the pandemic broke up, with strict health protocols to follow, it was hard to travel abroad. From then on, I've decided to be a local tourist guest of my own City/Province and experience Cebuano hospitality to help the tourism industry which is badly affected.  When I was browsing were to celebrate the Chinese New Year 2022 to welcome the Year of the Water Tiger,  Summit Galleria Cebu suddenly popped up online and days after, as a pageant fan, the Philippines won the\\Torch 3\\Stayed 3 nights here. Clean and comfy beds. Good AC, right water  pressure and heater is operational despite the City was impacted by super typhoon Odette where Metro Cebu has NO power and water in many areas. Breakfast plates for now since the Restaurant Providore is still closed. Room With big sized TV, electric kettle, small ref and good wifi. Complimentary Two small bottles of water daily. Each floor has complimentary water dispenserin the hallways. Nice staff. Would recommend.\\Miyang\\So I had my quarantine with this Hotel.  All I can say is the customer service is highly appreciated, since the day I arrived until I checked out.  If I request something they immediately have an action.  The rooms was clean and the ambiance is good.  Please extend my appreciation to Mr. Jilmer Cortez.  He helped me a lot. Even buy me some medicine because my stomach felt bad! Hardworking and approachable!  For all the staffs, thank you! Salamat!\\Lc\\Superb! Had a safe, clean, and warm stay. Staff made sure to look after the cleanliness of the room a day after the beginning of the stay. Will be sure to come and will definitely try their restaurant.\\Owen McBride\\A great clean hotel with a great staff. Helpful from the time we arrived on the doorstep until we checked out. A great experience. The hotel is perfectly located adjoined to the Robinson's Galleria Mall. A very short distance away (visible in the distance) SM City, Cebu. Very very close to Pier 1 and all fast craft. The staff were very accommodating to our needs for storage space due to a variety of over-sized Balikbayan boxes. The doormen were most helpful in ""flagging"" taxis. And the PNP on the premises were a very comforting thought. The room was pristine with a great view. Thanks to the entire staff. I am looking forward to staying there again in the future.\\Ghilord baguio\\This hotel is the best in term of cleanliness and ambiance and also the location itself close to malls,churches, and Port. I did my hotel quarantine for 10 days in Summit Galleria Cebu ,my room are big with dinning area,living area, big sleeping room and Big Comfort Room, crew and staff are friendly  they are well trained about protocols and guidelines .. good job\\Ron\\I stayed here for 8 nights to quarantine as a Returning Overseas Filipino (ROI). While I cannot fault the courtesy of the staff, the food was a major letdown.  I would give better meals to the homeless on the streets. Not once during the whole stay did they serve a fruit with the meals. If you want to eat healthy and stay sane while stuck in the hotel room, I suggest that you download Food Panda on your phone and get food delivered to you from your choice of restaurants. Otherwise, the whole experience could make you feel like you are paying to stay in a fancy hotel to eat a prisoner's food. It was depressing. I did not mind eating from a disposable plate with plastic spoon and fork if this is for health reasons, but I believe that a balanced meal is essential to a person's well\\IMGlobal77749\\the hotel has excellent customer service. they respond to inquiries, concerns and request immediately. they are very accommodating. I just wish they serve better food. for a 3 day quarantine, our hotel bill is a package with 3 meals a day. but it was very small servings. for the price paid, it should have been more, with more selection and servings. apart from food, i think the hotel is good. just a little pricey compared to others. the airport to hotel transpo should also be free and included in the reservation. but they charge every single activity.\\Francis\\they have a large room, a family of three is well accommodated. the staff are very polite and friendly, the food was great as well. place is very clean and comfy. didn't had the chance to visit the pool though. internet is fast but it sometimes get disconnected.\\Mark D\\not our first time here. and not our last Pool is great Limited menu due to pandemic, yet they tried their best to accommodate... not totally disappointed  Staff makes or breaks a property Staff here is world class, above average accommodating, concerned and attentive. Very very enjoyable stay and we will go again soon\\Glenn Guinto\\The location is excellent. The room is clean. However, the Internet is really slow it's totally unusable. I used mobile data so I could work.. :(  Hot shower is not working in our room.. :( I think the shower and toilet's glass doors should swing inward, instead of outward as it blocks passage and could bump into each other.  Our booking includes ""free breakfast."" Well, it's not really free since you can book without breakfast for a cheaper price.  You don't get to choose the type of breakfast. 1st day, sausage, scrambled eggs, and rice. 2nd day, tocino, scrambled eggs and rice.  3rd day, repeat 1st day :D sausage, scrambled eggs and rice. No offence meant, but their ""free"" breakfast reminds us of the meals served in inter-island passenger/ferry ships :D To their credit, they\\Eunice Gail O\\Our stay was amazing. A good getaway from a work day.   The room was very spacious and clean. The bed waaaaaas aaaaaaawesooooooome! It was big and so comfortable. Also the room lighting and color were very pleasant to see. To add, the block out curtains are really good. ‚ò∫Ô∏è\\steph_dmd\\I can attest to the great service of the banquet staff, delightful food and fabulous function hall. So thankful for Ms. Stephany Ca√±ete for accommodating our event last sept.17 in spite this coronavirus pandemic. Our event was a success big thanks to summit staff and crews. More power to all! May you continue to fulfill and bring happiness to all that needs your services.\\aguitongleoniza\\I had a very pleasant stay with great accommodations.  Room was big and comfortable.  People were kind and always smiling.  The front desk lady was also very helpful getting a grab car en route to the airport upon checking out.\\Ricardo\\I had an enjoyable stay at the Summit Hotel because the staff are helpful, the food is good, rooms are clean and comfortable and beside a mall. I have been a guest of this hotel for several times but my last stay was the most memorable one. I have reserved in Summit Circle but was was on my mind was Galleria but although I had no reservation they accommodated me instantly. Also I forgot my cellphone charger but they have a spare charger on the front desk so I was able to charge my phone. Thanks to that..\\kiietiu\\Naiwan ko yung pera ko sa may table dun sa room , nung tinawagan ko sila nahanap nila yung pera tapos pinakuha ko nalang sa pinsan ko. Thank you so much po , highly recommended, minsan nalang yung ganyan.\\Roman III Reyes\\It's very close to my Cebu office so I stay here whenever I am in Cebu (which is about 2 weeks out of every month). Convenient because it sits atop a mall where there's an abundance of choices for meals and shopping . The mall's quite new too and has a good variety of shops for almost all your needs. The breakfast buffet is excellent also. Each room has its own WiFi router so you get a good signal all the time.  What's not so good? Really small ref in the room, and only 4 clothes hangers (they don't expect you to stay too long I guess)...\\r0mmelreyes\\i always stay at the summit  galleria every time i travel to cebu which is a weeklong stay every 2 weeks. i like its convenience to my place of work and the amenities it offers especially the shops in the mall below where i can dine and buy items i suddenly need. the breakfast buffet is also excellent.\\stiflerspeilberg\\We stayed only 1 night but the customer service was the highlight... They were so kind and helpful from the moment we got out from our van until we left... Although, there was only 1 elevator working at that time, I understood the inconvenience because they were preparing for the sinulog festival... I love that the mall is just right there... You can eat, shop anytime... i wish we could‚Äôve stayed there for more days... Definitely one of our choices to stay in Cebu!\\Giusseppe S\\We got to the hotel at least an hour earlier than check in time but the receptionist did not make it difficult for us. she made arrangements so we could deposit our luggage at their luggage storage. Then asked us if we can allow a couple of minutes so they can check if they can allow us to check in earlier than expected. So my fiance and I just decided to grab a quick bite at the mall. Of which to my surprise, the hotel had access to where we need not go out as it was scorching hot out. After a sumptuous lunch, we can back to the hotel and our room was already ready. The room was really clean and the aircon was cold. Checking out was also a breeze.Too bad we only had time in our schedule for a one nightstay. But I would definitely be back if ever I am in the area."
