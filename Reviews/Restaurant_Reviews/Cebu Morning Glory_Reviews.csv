Cebu Morning Glory,"Patricia G|the menu is great as it has innovative dishes & accommodating staff for first timers. Its a cozy place for when you feel bringing a chunk group that you’ll pass by|André F|After trying other restaurants in the area (already reviewed also) this is a great option to go. Great food, good presentation, clean, helpful staff.
