Shawarma Gourmet,"ButterflyFairyTea|Had the most amazing chicken shawarma here, it was really saucy and the chicken was very juicy.

Many menus. Will come back soon|Lucky D|I was on a business trip in Cebu and was craving for Arabic food.  We visited shawarma gourmet for lunch and I have to admit that I had one of the best Arabic food outside Middle East.

Good food 
Good service 
Good price. 

Even just quality in general. Coming from Canada it is hard to find food in Cebu that is a reasonable price, that tastes good, and does not make me sick. 

Will be coming...|MarinaHadad|We came following recommendations on TripAdvisor and really enjoyed ourselves.

We got introduced to other...|chrisalfaro17|The hummus & baba ghanoush was incredible. 5/5. 

The food after that was incredibly okay. The meat was dry. The tabbouleh tasted old and boring.
