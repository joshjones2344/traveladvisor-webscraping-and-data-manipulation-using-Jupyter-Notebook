And don't forget to grab a cup of joe.|Roanne D|I love the place, the staff, products and ambience.

Very lovely owner and staff. I can totally recommend their daily cakes and coffee. You can even buy some nice souvenirs and postcards made by locals. Will definitely go again!!|Creselda V|They sell handcrafted solid tonewood ukuleles handcrafted by local luthiers in Mactan. If you are into ukuleles, you must visit Uke Hub Kafe. Their staff will help you find the perfect ukulele for you. 

They have unlimited WiFi, sockets for your laptop & other gadgets..."
