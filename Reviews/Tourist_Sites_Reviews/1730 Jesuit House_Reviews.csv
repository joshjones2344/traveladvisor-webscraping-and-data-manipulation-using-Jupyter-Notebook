1730 Jesuit House,"Florida_family_kids|One of the original buildings for this area by the church very interesting Architect, an original ceilings, walls and floors|Jeah20|It was an amazing experience, seeing the antiques are more expensive than my wallet, and the atmosphere made me feel more like I'm really in the past.|Francheska C|This hidden gem provided a captivating journey through history, and I was enthralled by the well-preserved artifacts and exhibits. The people who take care of the place were incredibly accommodating, making the experience even more enjoyable.|Alyssa Magno|It was an experience to visit here as the meticulous restoration efforts have maintained its original structure, allowing visitors like me to step into the past and gain a deeper understanding of Cebu's history. I wished that there was signage around the area because the location was quite hard to precisely locate. Regardless, I had a great time here|Faith S|A great site to learn about history, art, and culture can be found here. As you explore the exhibits and discover more about the things on show, a museum visit can be both informative and pleasant. It was an incredible experience, and I also learned about Cebu's history in addition to that of the Philippines. Our trip is definitely worthwhile.|Czanine J|I recently had a pleasure of visiting the Jesuit house during Gabii sa Kabilin 2023, and it was an absolute delight. The heritage house offers a fascinating glimpse into the city‚Äôs colonial past, providing us with a rich and immersive experience. There was also a live harp playing in the background which added to the nice vibe.|Rigil Kent Manatad|What impressed me most about the 1730 Jesuit House was its commitment to preserving history. The meticulous restoration work carried out on the house is evident in every detail, allowing visitors to truly appreciate the authenticity and charm of the original structure. It's a testament to the dedication and passion of the individuals involved in maintaining this cultural landmark. The interior of the Jesuit House is a treasure trove of artifacts and antiques. Each room showcases different aspects of Cebu's past, including religious relics, household items, and furniture from various periods. Walking through the rooms felt like stepping into a different era, with each item telling a unique story of the people who once inhabited the house.|SofiaB|The Jesuit House was an interesting visit. The house was able to preserve its vintage quality. We were able to learn about its history through the photos posted on its walls and the information given to us by the stationed guides. I also liked viewing the vintage items and artifacts that were on display. Lastly, I enjoyed listening to the harp performer present at the time.|Trisha Rebayla|The 1730 Jesuit House is certainly a hidden treasure within Parian. I noticed that the museum had areas which were still under construction. Despite that, the staff were quite welcoming with their sunny disposition and warm greetings as my friends and I entered the site. I would like to add that having free ice cream to end the museum tour was a brilliant idea! It was a humid night and it really helped cool us down.Although the whole concept of being a ""hidden treasure"" is great, I would recommend having 2-3 people from the staff accommodate guests from the outside (preferably where you could see traffic - the kind where there are people walking along the street) and not just from the registration area. My friends and I had difficulty finding the museum because of how mysterious it looked when in reality, we actually passed by the area at one point and did not even realize that it was a museum that was part of Gabii sa Kabilin 2023.I also suggest to improve the lighting from the outside because the street where the museum is located was quite dark which made my friends and I hesitant to go along that part of the road.Regardless, we have learned so much being inside the museum. It was like revisiting history all over again as we looked at the furniture, the infrastructure as a whole, and of course, the artifacts which were housed within the museum.Good luck on your future events! I hope to see you guys again the next time there'll be another GSK!|Nicole D|Although the museum have some parts under construction, the staffs are really accommodating and I can really now understand why is it called ""a secret museum"" because at first glance you won't know it's a museum because it is used as a hardware warehouse but inside lies an old house well maintained by the people who works there.|Reann G|Love the airconditioned place. Every relic found inside were amazing to see and I feel like it really shows an important part of what our history really looked like. Also, loved how they gave out free icecream after finishing the whole house [I think it was because of the GSK happening too] ü§ò|Quevyn Adjutor Abuzo|As one of the oldest houses in Cebu/in the country, the place is a history lesson of Cebu... incarnate. Considering a coin was found buried in the house that dated back to the Ming Dynasty, one is surely left baffled on how an infrastructure older than their greatest, greater, great grandparents continues to stand on its ground.|Czar Emmanuel|Along with the nearby Yap-Sandiego ancestral house, this old Jesuit house, tucked inside a Chinese hardware, is considered as one of the oldest houses in the Philippines. An inscription inside the house dates its construction to the year 1730. Historical records say that it was formerly used as Jesuit house or one of its mission houses. Inside you'll be accompanied by a tour guide who will tell you about its history and guide you through its various rooms.|Xerxes R|Read about this place on trip advisor and am def happy we visted. A  charge of 50pesos is negligible for this slice of history. Our guide was informative and explained in detail also answering our questions with patience and interest. Def give this a VISIT have a blast.|LolaGo1|I had a difficult time finding local transport from Independence Park to the Sugbo Museum,My ‚ÄúAngkas‚Äù driver erroneously took me here. Entrance fee is 50 pesos. There is a very busy hardware selling panels of metals located in front of this house.The house is authentic, its living areas such as bedroom, living room, kitchen, reception area, etc are still intact. Also on display are some artifacts found underground,  maps, pictures, etc.Suggestion: Separate the Hardware from this attraction. It was very dusty here during my visit!|Dkkeeling|Not a lot to see or spend a lot of time overInteresting with the Spanish heritage and some relics interesting|jem2811|Very interesting, considering that not all are aware of it. Even a nearby resident has admitted to be unaware of this. Not as ‚Äúpopular‚Äù other museums within the Parian District probably because of its unimpressive tarpaulin sign and it being ‚Äúburied‚Äù in the midst of a hardware of its 3rd owner. Displays and galleries are well organized that its indeed a travel through time capsules.   Length of visit is dependent on whether one wants to read al the write ups.  Photography is allowed, unlike in museums in other parts of the country. It is actually the oldest recorded house in Cebu City, with the year of construction above the original main entrance. (Unfortunately my photo files are too large for posting. I have however uploaded them in the page Ancestral Houses in the Philippines and Advocates for Heritage Preservation on FB)|Poor guide|Google map it. It will cosr you 2 u.s dollars or less.. they provide you an english tour guide, they are very accomodating.. then you get to meet the owner who is very hospitable. Its just across the cebu heritage monument.|Andrew P|Unique Museum in the heart of Cebu. Nestle in the middle of a hardware store. One of the most interesting museums I have visited. Very informative about the history of Cebu.|travel_lusting|We did go here and found it interesting to look around.  Unfortunately, we were here on a tour.  I would not pay a tour guide just for a look around here.  Worth going if you can make it here on your own."
