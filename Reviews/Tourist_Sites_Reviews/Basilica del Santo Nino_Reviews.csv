Basilica del Santo Nino,"alwaystravelsf|Was quite fascinating how old and beautiful this church is.  Was there on weekday and had a mass starting outside of all places.  So many people attend that they have outdoor structure where parishioners can sit under the bleachers. Basilica was very nice and also go to left side where yiu can walk down long hallway to see the small doll or baby Jesus santo Nino.  Bring a handheld fan if you can as it gets hot .|Waldo Manalang|Bas is a magnificent religious site in Cebu City, Philippines. The basilica holds a significant place in Filipino history as it houses the Santo Niño, a revered Catholic icon and the oldest religious relic in the country. The grand architecture, intricate details, and vibrant atmosphere of the basilica create a powerful and spiritual experience for visitors, making it a must-visit destination for both religious pilgrims and cultural enthusiasts.|M Earl P|This place has incredible energy. We loved it! If you are ever in Cebu, make this your 1st or 2nd stop! Make sure you take time to offer prayers at Magellan's Cross!|ybo7000|Beautiful church. It's less crowded now after the pandemic. One of the top places that tourists visited when they come to cebu.|loo c|The Santo Niño de Cebu is said to have been brought to the Philippines by the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521, and was given as a gift to the wife of Rajah Humabon, the ruler of Cebu at the time. The statue was later rediscovered by Spanish conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi in 1565, and was enshrined in the church that would later become the Basilica del Santo Niño.|jajavalB|I went here in the 3rd weekend of January where sinulog2023 coming back on street performance and street dance at the new venue of SRP cebu city. Firstly I visited this important church where Santo Nino ( baby Jesus) places in the shrine . The dat before Grand procession , it’s mass celebration to commemorate Santo nino first came to colonial  city , Cebu by Magellane. The interior of the church itself is extravaganza arts of Gothic era. It’s crowded but the ambience was very tranquil.|Peter M|Santo Niño Basilica, is a basilica in Cebu City  was founded in 1565  and is  the oldest Roman Catholic church in the country, It is very close to Magellan's cross|Oscardog16|Historical location  that is important to the citizens. Pedestrian traffic is well controlled so as worshippers are not disturbed,|uzmelissa|Spanish historic effects at this church is a very good symbol of their religious sites in Cebu. A nice walking distance all other historic spots and feel warm feelings inside|Reslimpan|Interesting to visit and see. It has historical significance. I realize I need to study more about Philippines history prior to the arrival of Magellan. It appears to me that the Philippines didn’t really exist until the catholics arrived, that just don’t feel right. The basilica among the worldwide population of such buildings are average at best.|thefilipinotraveler|This is the oldest church in the country so it has a lot of history including having the oldest religious image (image of Sto. Nino de Cebu). As a Roman Catholic, I have visited it a few times and would really recommend it to other Christians.|Ricoy|Everytime I go to Cebu for business or pleasure, I always try to drop by the Basilica to say my prayers of gratitude to the Mahal na Sto.Nino. For his bountiful blessings and for taking good care for me and my family.|lovehols|Well worth visiting. The doll-like image of Jesus is there to see. It's as old as Magellan, dating back to 1521. The rest of the building, dating back to 1565, will astound.|A Santiago|Place is rich in history and cultural heritage! it's amazing how they've maintained it after all these years.|Von Geraldizo|If your a roman catholic or curious with Philippines dominant religion then you’ve come to the right place. This church is very rich with history and cultural heritage.|lara|I went here with my mother. I can say that it was a very beautiful memory to cherish because churches, especially like the Basilica del Santo Nino, which is a part of our history as well way back the colonization of the Spaniards, have different hit in my heart, considering how well maintained and beautiful it was when I got there inside and out, and it is still has its beauty up until today for sure. I enjoyed exploring the façade of the church and how it looks incredibly great inside. All in all the experience was great, I hope I could visit the Basilica again soon.|London-Phil|As there are many such reviews on the Basilica del Santo Nino here on TA, I thought I might offer a slightly different perspective on such a well visited subject. I visited the Basilica del Santo Nino whilst in Cebu in March 2020, when everything was still open thankfully so I was able to walk freely around.It is certainly impressive, especially when viewed in the context of the poverty of the docks/piers which are but a short stroll away. I know this, because I spent hours walking through both on the day I visited. I am used to poverty overseas, but found the very young girls (children), clearly with their own young babies, especially upsetting. I make this observation only because of the very visible difference between the prosperity of the two factions, and not as a specific criticism of either.   The Basilica del Santo Nino, is a beautiful Catholic Church, located in the downtown area of Cebu City, next to the Magellan Cross which, is another highly visited tourist point. As is usual for me, the most compelling and therefore memorable aspect of my visit was the human interaction enjoyed, this rather than the glitz and glory of the main building itself.I remember well, a smiley Lady of some advanced years, in yellow (see pics), attempting to sell me some candles. Unfortunately, I had just purchased a large, Holy candle from the Church shop, this for a friend back in the UK who is considerably more devout than I am. So sadly in this case, I felt unable to accommodate her request to buy more.I did however ask, if she might like to come home to the UK with me as I was both alone abroad and sadly, unloved at home. Alas, she broke my heart and we subsequently parted with the cheeriest of laughs and giggles being exchanged between us. The point I'm really trying to make here is a simple one. Yes, the building is beautiful and clearly, religiously significant. I am myself a Catholic who studied theology when younger. The real beauty for me however, will always be the people who inhabit and visit these sites rather than the bricks, mortar and Gold in this instance, that was required to build them. Over the years, I have been to many such Grand Places of Worship, and the thoughts and memories that have lingered the longest, have always been centred around conversations enjoyed whilst there, rather than the Grandeur of the places themselves. In which case, if ever given the opportunity, go and explore the Basilica del Santo Nino and enjoy the beauty that is self-evident from near every corner and angle. Above all else though, bring some money for the truly lovely Lady in yellow, as I have absolutely no doubt, she will still be there and asking if you might buy her candles. Remember to smile when you speak, as you just never know where the next life affirming conversation will come from, even when you don't actually speak the same language. That for me, is the true beauty and wonder, of Travel! As always, happy and safe travelling. Phil|Francis_Elvis_Verdin|A Place that you could remember the resemblance of how we invade by Spaniards the Philippines for almost 333 years.|ScambusterSZ|While we couldn't get in, we had a nice walk around as part of longer walk around the village. It between the main drag through town and the ocean front. You can also see the museum nearby.|Roger M|A beautiful place in which to contemplate your inner self. Can never visit Cebu without spending a few minutes in this holy place."
