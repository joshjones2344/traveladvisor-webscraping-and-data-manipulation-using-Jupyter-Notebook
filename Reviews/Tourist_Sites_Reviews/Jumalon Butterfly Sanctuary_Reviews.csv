Jumalon Butterfly Sanctuary,"shauna lynn R|When we arrived the owner was in a meeting but a former employee who was visiting offered to take us on a tour. Later the owner who is the son of Julian N. Jumalon came and told us some more about his father and his amazing work. Both were so knowledgeable, answered our questions, and gave us so much information. We saw many caterpillars, pupae, and butterflies before going to see the collection of specimens from around the world and then to the building that houses the art. Lepido mosaic is art made from butterfly wings which is very impressive and beautiful but there is also many paintings. These folks really care about keeping this place going and preserving the life work of Julian N. Jumalon. I would definitely recomend checking it out.|Beatriz F|I first visited Jumalon Butterfly Sanctuary in 2000.  I met the owner Mr. Julian Jumalon. He was 90 years old. I learned about the Sanctuary from his daughter, Dr. Humaida Jumalon who I met at Baha'i Conference at the University in Puerto Princesa. Her father was kind and so knowledgeable about butterflies and moths.  He gave me a tour of his art gallery.  We had tea and wonderful conversation.  It was one of the most peaceful places I visited in the Philippines!!  At that moment, it was difficult to imagine it had been severely destroyed by those who initiated World War II. The suffering seemed so far away. I learned so much from him!  And, I will return again!.|Adrian S|Really worth going - many beautiful butterflies. The manager is very knowledgeable and has lots of stories to tell!|Mr_Biyahero|While in Cebu city I searched best place to visit, and the butterfly sanctuary seemed interesting. My girlfriend and I spent the day roaming Cebu, eventually getting to the sanctuary. Spending time at the sanctuary with Miss Jumalon was such an incredible experience she took us through the sanctuary showing us her extensive butterfly/insect display, showing all the beautiful art and contribution to science her father (Julian Jumalon) made. We learnt a lot and we were lucky enough to have a one on one educational experience with Miss Jumalon. I could not speak more highly of this place and Miss Jumalon herself. One of a kind experience that I am glad to have lived. Hopefully more people discover this gem of Cebu.|Scenic788463|Unfortunately when I went there were not many butterflies. They run an open garden, not one completely enclosed by netting, as many other places do, so the butterflies are free to come and go. Despite this, the lady showing us around (daughter of the founder), was such an amazing source of information. She explained everything about butterflies, caterpillars, their lifecycle, different types of butterfly, etc. I learned a lot and it is always a pleasure to listen to someone who has such a passion for their subject. I definitely recommend this place. The complete tour is around 1hr.|evamH8572HA|The place is not as spectacular one like in Singapore or Thailand. It even has limited parking and very close proximity to small residences. But if you are interested to learn about butterflies species that graced and lived in Cebu City, visit this place.|Leigh K|What a disappointing place...Someone's house, with some butterflies flying around, tour guide was a young girl still at school.After the garden tour you are taken inside the house, 1 room to be exact, and shown different types of butterflies, beetles & other insects which have been preserved in picture frames.Last part of the tour we were taken into the art gallery... well taken into a room with some pictures on the wall.Wouldn't recommend at al..|Non s|I thoroughly enjoyed my visit at the butterfly sanctuary. I do wish I had brought bug spray as the mosquitoes are prevalent in the heavily shrubbed garden for the butterflies. And this is their rainy season as well.  The young man, who is an intern there, gave me my tour. I went on a Sunday morning while everyone was at church so it was basically a private tour as I was the only one there during that time so that was nice.  It is basically like a small home with a large garden that happens to have dozens of butterflies living there.  They keep the caterpillars in an enclosure to allow them to become butterflies so prey does not get to them as many of the butterflies are endangered of becoming extinct. So many already are, with just a few different types left. I went inside after my tour of the garden and was able to meet one of Jumalon’s sons. He was nice and knowledgeable and showed me some more about the work they do there. Much of the art made there is made of old butterfly wings. It’s really quite cool.  I’m not sure small children would enjoy this but it’s great for older kids and adults.  Spent about 45 minutes there.|mary jean N|the place is one of the tourists attractions yet it needs improvement to really attracts visitors. the gift shop is quite outdated and pricey. But their restroom is quite clean.|Anthony L|Was worried when the taxi driver did not know where it was in a small city like Cebu you'd expect them to know. Its really someones house with a large garden. Was a interesting talk on the history of the collection, but there was little for small children to see as there were not many butterfly's.If you have a couple of hours to stare visiting is an option, but make sure you take bug spray for walking round the garden."
