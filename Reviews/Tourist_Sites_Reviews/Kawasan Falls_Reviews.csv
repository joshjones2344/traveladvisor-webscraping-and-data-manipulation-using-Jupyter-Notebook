Kawasan Falls,"Roger K|Good time!!  It's fun. A bit touristy but it's a good experience.  Add the Whale Shark tourist trap and it makes for a good time.|Liau Yuan Wei|There are many different tour groups offering canyoneering at Kawasan Falls, for us we booked via the owner of Cuesta Resort (where we were staying). Cost is 1500 pesos + 1000 pesos for Zipline straight to starting point, which we didn’t. Must do with a local tour guide (Don’t go off on your own) because they really know where’s the safe path at through the canyon. We wore the life-vests and helmets provided for by the resort and took a minivan there (Was about 15mins/5km away). We then walked about 20mins in to the starting point (can’t drive in as there’s no gravel road, just a small trekking path), where we saw chickens and goats! We didn’t want to spend so much money on the Zipline so we didn’t take, although the group ahead of us said it was crazily fun! The canyoneering itself was one of the most exhilarating adventure we had! We trekked through the river, walking on rocks and swimming in the river at certain parts, and we jumped off at 6 different spots during the walk. The jumps ranges from easy 2m jumps to a 15m jump near the end. There was supposedly a 20m jump at the last waterfall but our guide didn’t allow us to jump as the water wasn’t deep enough to cushion our fall. We had a hell of time jumping off, especially at the 15m jump as I keep climbing up the cliff to jump 2x! There was also a swing where u pay 10 pesos to swing your body to the river and let go. Our tour guide was also nice to help us take photos with my phone and he knew the best scenic spots to take pictures at! I paid 150 pesos to buy a waterproof pouch at the resort. Overall, I highly recommend this activity, but please be physically okay because there is a lot of walking. My Apple Watch told me we walked for at least 6km. Attire: We wore swimming trunks & wet shoes, which on hindsight was abit crazy because we had microcuts on our bodies & legs while climbing through the rocks. What the guide wore make the best sense for protection - Swimsuit + Long swimming pants.|Christian A|It was an amazing experience.
