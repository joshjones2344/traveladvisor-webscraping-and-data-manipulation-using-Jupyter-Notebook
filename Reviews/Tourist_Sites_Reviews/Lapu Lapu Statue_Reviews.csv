Lapu Lapu Statue,"Sydney G|A performance was planned for Gabii sa Kabilin 2023, and practically every museum had some sort of performance for the event. However, I thought the role-playing performance in the Shrine was the greatest of the bunch. There were also a number of food stalls, which led us to conclude (after testing)¬†that this area offered¬†the best food. Furthermore, the breathtaking sight of the historical landmark late at night with the lights illuminated was unlike any other.|Roald B|The costumes were very nice and the participants at the entrance were smiley and welcoming. There are certain parts that are filled with lights and the place is very windy.They reenact the story of Magellan and Lapu Lapu as well.|Unoh Borbajo|The shrine is a well-maintained complex that consists of several elements. The centerpiece is the larger-than-life statue of Lapu-Lapu, symbolizing his heroism and bravery during the battle. The statue stands tall and is an iconic representation of Filipino nationalism and resistance.The museum provides valuable insights into the events that unfolded and the cultural significance of Lapu-Lapu in Philippine history.  The surrounding area offers a pleasant environment with well-manicured gardens, walkways, and benches, providing a serene setting for visitors to relax and reflect on the historical significance of the site.|Ethan Cortrip|The site is a tourist place, designed and manufactured for tourists or visitors. Too many people and noise in the evening, because of the rave parties with too powerful sound system.|Keith F|An important historical site for Filipinos but a couple of monuments and a statue is all that is here.|Reslimpan|It was great to see how proud all Filipinos visiting the Lapu Lapu statues were. This 16th century Manny Pacquiao slayed Magellan on this very spot.|oldhometown99|For world history buffs, it's a must visit spot.  The man who led the first sailing expedition around the world met his end at this spot in 1521 at the hands of Lapu Lapu and his men.  A memorial to Magellan and the statue of Lapu Lapu are the highlights in a wide plaza.  Area is safe (although parking spots are not plentiful).  A bazaar of local goods are also featured on the grounds.For those who don't have any appreciation for history...it will be a bore.  For others, it will be fascinating.  Know which type of person you and your traveling companions are.|Barry J Parks@gmail.com|It‚Äôs quite impressive and the history of the area is fascinating and well explained. Being able to see the actual beach where Magellan was defeated is very important. Try to visit at night when the tide moves out.|Marco R|Of all the places we were, this was one of the ones that touched us the most, for the sake of being Portuguese and having been the place where Ferdinand Magellan was killed. Unlike everything that surrounds this place, here everything is spacious and minimally organized and careful.Tributes are paid to Lapu Lapu (named as the first Philippine national hero), the Ferdinand Magellan, commander of the first fleet that circumnavigated the world and all the historical achievements accomplished by the Spaniards in this stoppage.|Atral R|Its literally a big copper statue of Lapu Lapu.There is also a mural nearby showing the  europeans being defeated by his warriors.Only point of interest is the 2 sides of the commemorative plaque, written at different times, they reflect different ideologies, but its not worth going there for these and the row of badly placed tourist trap shops|Genesis Vargas|I loved history class, and coming to this place was an amazing feeling. Datu Lapulapu is our first Filipino Hero. We are very proud on how he depend our land in his time.|Cutie|Nice to revisit the past to appreciate the present. :-)  Historically speaking, Christianity was gained because of this strong man who fought for freedom against intruders in this land.|Ferdinand del Toro|The statue is cool to see, but it's just a statue. It doesn't do or say anything. Can't get anything from it, like all other statues. The story behind the statue is interesting. The area the statue is located in is awesome.  Lots of restaurants and places for a drink. Nightlife and things to see and do.|Maria Edilfa J|Very nice and historic place a great experience to think about history and courage and the love of the land for his men.|Mark D|If you are in Lapu Lapu yo are probably staying in a resort, take a few minutes to see this and get a few pics.....even if you are not.. cool place to go,, look around.. historical.. when I was there, it was quiet, a lot of flowers,, rather peaceful in the immediate area of the statue...|Dianne A|This statue is now standing close to a market selling souvenirs. In the photo he's surrounded by foliage looking proud. Now he's standing in what looks like a car park. What a shame. This is amazing history on Mactan Island. Maybe he'll be moved again. There's nothing written there about the battle or how brave he must have been. Sad let down what a shame. Dianne.|Bob1O|Lots of souvenir vendors. Not much there but is of historical significance. Not many people were there the day we were there. 1/2 hour was more than enough although we were offered an opportunity to rent a boat. Still worth a visit if you are looking to do some touristy sightseeing.|L ~ ÊûóÊÅ©|This is what it looks like during day and night. There is market inside the park where you can buy souvenirs and snacks while walking around the place. The market is open at day until night time|Pio|we went here for our company event.. i realize the last time i visit here it was not renovate. . now a very big changes and more nice to stay with children. . .|Marty|Chief Lapu-Lapu (1491-1542) ... was a ruler of Mactan Island , in the Visayas ( Cebu Island Area ) Philippines üáµüá≠ regard him as the first Filipino Hero ... ‚Äòcause he was the first native to resist Spanish colonisation of the Philippines As on 27th April 1521 ... when explorer Ferdinand Magellan , with 3 boatloads of Spaniards & 20 boatloads of Cebuanos sailed over to Mactan Island , to help a friendly chief , against Lapu-Lapu ( local island Chief ) & his men , armed only with native weapons & shields defended themselves against Spanish Lancers & bows & arrows , as the invading Spaniards & Cebuanos were driven back to their boats ... not before the Spanish Leader Magellan , met death in the hands of Lapu-Lapu Also at least 14 other Spaniards & around 150 native warriors were killedNow on Mactan Island , on what is believed to be the exact spot where Magellan fell & died , now stands impressive monuments in honor of the Lapu-Lapu & the gallant explorer Mangellan ... in a large tourist spot ... this park has free entrance"
