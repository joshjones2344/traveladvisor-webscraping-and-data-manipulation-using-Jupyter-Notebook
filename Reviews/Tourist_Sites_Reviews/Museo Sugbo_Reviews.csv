Museo Sugbo,"Alexia T|The museum is beautifully preserved, the things that can be seen there is so beautifully created. It is accessible to the public because it is located near the street.|Glide Deniere|My groupmates and I had a wonderful experience in the museum. It was great being able to visit such a place.|Judd Sydney G|The museum's numerous displays and diverse collection of artworks and artifacts fascinated us. One of the most memorable pieces of art we discovered was of men holding chickens in order to start a cockfight. Nonetheless, during Gabii sa Kabilin, Museo Sugbo was unquestionably one of the night's highlights, especially with their well-prepared performances.|Yann|Museo Sugbo is a captivating museum that provides a comprehensive overview of Cebu's history and culture. The exhibits are thoughtfully curated and showcase a wide range of artifacts and displays. The museum's layout and organization make it easy to navigate and understand the historical narrative. Out of the three attractions of Cebu that we have visited during the Gabii sa Kabilin, this was by far my most favorite!|Kate|Museo Sugbo offered an indeed captivating journey through the history and rich heritage of Cebu. Overall, it was an educational and memorable experience to be in Museo Sugbo.|Kaye F|Upon entering the museum, I was immediately struck by the well-curated exhibits and the attention to detail in recreating the wartime era. One aspect that truly stood out was the multimedia presentations and interactive exhibits.  It was a thoughtful and engaging approach that made the exhibits even more immersive.|Waldo Manalang|The museum offered a fascinating journey through the rich history and heritage of the region, with well-curated exhibits showcasing artifacts, photographs, and interactive displays. The restored building and knowledgeable staff made Museo Sugbo such a fun and knowlegable place to visit|Metchel Ann Rodriguez|One of the best museums we've ever been to. There are numerous artifacts and concise historical accounts. The timeline and information are quite well organized. Being there and getting a glimpse of Cebu's past feels really pleasant.|Rivkah Marie S|My favorite part was the secret thing inside the box and I was amazed by the arts inside it. I was a 10 for me.|Kurt E|One of the better museums that we have visited. Lots of artifacts and clear historical narratives. Great organization of  the timeline and facts. Feels very good to be there and have a glance on what the past Cebu looks like. A must visit for history enthusiasts. I wish they had more space for more artifacts though. Overall, it was a great learning experience.|Marty|Museo Sugbo ... is the Cebu Provincial Museum , located in the former Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center ( Prison ) This Cebu City Historical Museum , is found over a kilometre up the same road , from Plaza IndependenciaThe historical prison , now museum was built from coral stone ... some of this stone is from a demolished church , in the late 1870A few of this museums collection are :-• The Pre-Colonial Gallery• The Spanish Colonial Gallery• The Katipunan Revolution and the American Colonial Gallery• The War Memorial Gallery• The Museum of Philippine Political History The Prison housed not only criminals in its 135 year history - from 1870 to 2004. * During the revolution many of the Katipuneros ( revolutionist against Spanish Rule ) were incarcerated here without trial & many of them were eventually executed in nearby Carreta cemetery* During the Japanese occupation WW2 , guerrillas were imprisoned here , after enduring torture under the hands of the Kempeitai ( the Japanese secret police ) * After the war , many of the collaborators in Cebu were also imprisoned here|LolaGo1|On a Monday, I had a difficult time looking for transport from Fort San Pedro to this place.On my second attempt, I found it to be open and got excited when I learned that entrance fee is FREE!One room shows items related to various presidents of the. Philippines. Another one shows the history of Philippine Independence while another room shows relics of the past.Recommended to visit this FREE Museum!|Bea P|Cute free museum with multiple different exhibits ranging between the history of Cebuano press, the Japanese occupation, and city planning. Not necessarily a must-see, but definitely a nice respite from the searing heat if walking from Fort San Pedro to Casa Gorordo.|Lawland L|Great story about Cebu.  I started my trip with the visit and it gave me inspiration and a history that is meaningful and deep.  So much richness and details from prehistoric times and to present|Bob Ouano|Unlike Casa Gorordo which is privately run, this museum is government run (Province I think) and you can definitely tell the difference. Our tour guide was a student (Tourism I think{?} I forgot now), she had some knowledge of her subject matters and her grammar was quite faulty but made up for all of it with her attitude, smile, and very pleasant disposition. There were two sections of some five presentations, that had airconditioning and the rest you sweat like everybody else. The place is very accessible, and can be, maybe, enjoyable.|Kleinberg Fletc... T|Enrich your mind with knowledge about the past while having fun at the same time here in Museo Sugbo. Here you can learn lots of insights about how our forebears lived before, during, and after the Spanish Era. Read some letters written by Legazpi himself to the King of Spain (that's if you can understand Castilian, hehe), see an actual bomb used by the Americans during World War 2 (its really huge), and a lot more!There are just lots of things you can grasp here in Museo Sugbo. The museum has several galleries that features the entire era of Cebuano history, from the Precolonial up to the Japanese Occupation. There are also new galleries that were later added which are also very interesting to visit. The “Rice Gods and Saints” is a gallery that features a collection of anitos and pots in Ifugao. There is also a gallery for the National Historical Commission that elaborates the evolution of the “bayan” a local political entity during the precolonial era to the modern cities we have today.Each galleries are air-conditioned, with a free guided tour for your convenience. The entrance fee is only P75.00 but locals do get a much cheaper discounted price. A souvenir shop and a cafe is also available though it isn't open all the time.|Vic Raymund|This is used to be a Prison Cell & converted into a Museum. They also accepts for Functions & Party.|Andrew Scott G|Take the tour, the guides are great at showing you around and explaining things.  Lots of great artifacts and displays.|Felixberto E|The tour guide was very helpful with the historical display and artifacts, we got to learn more about own ethnic origins! Very interesting displays, very good museum guides.|Edwin R|This museum is not that big, but it packs a lot of history.  My favorite was during The World War II.  I didn't know that the Filipinos had briefly used Japanese currency.  Their new ""Rice of Gods"" room was amazing.  Our tour guide mentioned a private donor from a Filipino philanthropist, donated everything in the room to share the history of Cebu.  We were also educated that Museo Gugbo was originally a prison.  There were still marks of prisoners name and other carvings during that era.  One highlight that was also a favorite of mine was the walk of fame wall where all the past Presidents of the Philippines were hung in portrait paintings.  Next to their portraits shares a brief history of their life and accomplishments during their time in office.  I highly recommend if you have time during your visit to Cebu City, pay a visit here.  You will learn a great deal about Philippine history and the native tribes of Cebu.Cheers!"
