Pescador Island,"uzmelissa|Nice snorkeling spot for corals especially, some people wrote it's not perfect after thypoon may be it's a really better before but at overall it took 1 hour snorkeling around there and we saw lots of corals and fish, it was enough and enjoyable spot for us and our tour brought us to sardines and turtles to Moalboal, we swam 1 hour also there. Tour spots are fare I think, I would recommend ðŸ‘Œ|joywu1001|The guide told us that it was full of beautiful coral and sealife two years ago, but the devastating typhoon killed a lot of it a year ago. Currentlym they're still working to recreate the coral and sealife. During my snorkel, I did see quite a few fish of different colors. I think this place is worth going if you're not a great swimmer, and have worries about the sea current or big waves. The boatmen bring you to a peaceful area where there are no waves, and you can snorkel or dive easily. Snorkeling here boosted my confidence in getting into the waters more.|Kozi Tsen|The tour centers are asking 3,000 (per boat) for the island hopping! And on top of that, 100 per person for environmental tax. We were only 2 persons, so we asked if we can join other groups, they said they don't accommodate joiners anymore due to covid. I highly doubt that! I think each boatmen are waiting ""in-line"" for their turn to take tourists and now they want each boatmen to earn each day from the tourists. The more groups of tourists, the more boatmen will be needed! Can u imagine? I think it is unfair! So we didn't do the island hopping. Anyway it is only for this island Pescador.And also corals are now dead due to the typhoon but they will not tell you anything, of course! All they want is your money, not your welfare! Take note and Be careful!|Frank|Avoid going if you're snorkeling. The corals were damaged during a  recent typhoon and there's pretty much nothing left. You are wasting your money if you go. My gf and I were so disappointed. Spend your money on other tours around. Yes, they bring you to Moalboal beach for the sardine and turtles but don't waste your time for Pescador Island.|Marc G|On the positive side: Nice topography with walls dropping down to -50m, the Skull cave is very interesting.Good place for freediving for advanced divers.On the negative side: every island hoping boat anchors on the shallow plateau, all the hard corals were killed by anchors a long time ago. The site if  over-fished.. It is  be part of the Tanon Strait Marine Park, it has current and it is surrounded by deep water, it should be full of pelagic predators.. But because of constant fishing, it is empty of fish. Divers are lucky if they see a couple of snappers and a skipjack tuna. You ' ll be happy if you like frogfish and nudibranchesLet' s hope that this place will finally get the protection it deserves..|Steve|It's an awesome day trip! Take a boat from almost anywhere in Moalboal, sit back, relax and enjoy the 25 to 35 minute ride to Pescador Island. It's just a small little outcrop in the middle of the straight between Cebu and Negros. We don't usually go for the Island itself (there's nothing really on it and it is protected), but it is a favorite spot to hang out, snorkel, dive, and enjoy the beautiful coral reefs surrounding it. I spent my 49th birthday out there. We had three boats full of family and just partied!|Jakub H|We did there 2 dives. First by east side and second one by west side. This island is full  of live. I also like chinese tourists drowning on the surface.|Cynthia M|Great Dive location.  Did it twice.  A definite must do!!!  The marine life is plentiful.  If you take your time and look carefully you can see lots of small creatures.|é«˜å±•æ–¯|We went to Pescador as part of a 3 stop boat trip which included turtles, sardines, and Pescador Island.  The turtles were very cool, sardines were the real highlight, but the island was a bit underwhelming.|elinak821|we went there for a few hours on a diving boat. very nice experience, clean' beutiful location, many turtles"
