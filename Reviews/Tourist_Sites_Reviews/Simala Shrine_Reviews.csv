Simala Shrine,"SimonOnVacation|Booked a private vehicle to get the shrine.  The place was not far from Cebu City but the traffic and rough roads to get here is the reason for close to 3hr drive.The place had a lot of people, we went directly up the main church.  Mini-stores lined the side entrance, people buying souvenirs, religious items and also lighting candles.People stay indoors to pray and ask for intercession for their prayers.|Mars C|Use City Tours, 3800 for 4 people. The shrine is breathtaking.. Places to see for 3800, whale watching,|Mark K|Lovely church, very nice grounds, and church.  Special meeting to Catholics.  We enjoyed and took lots of photos. Worth the trip|uzmelissa|I'm impressed so much with this place, architecture and ambiance of this church is very different that I've ever seen in Philippines. So many local people visits there with their pure feelings and it's location at very crowded town worth to visit|jazeejaz|Simala quite extensive. Altho for us my 74yo Sister and I stayed close to the Church. We lit candles for All Souls Day. It‚Äôs a must see Id say.|frenchy8888|This place is so beautiful and sacred‚Ä¶ Breathtaking It‚Äôs like a castle - I love it !!!

VILMA VITUG JENNINGS here üòç all my love üòç|Zayn|Today, we visited this place. We ought to have a solemn prayer unfortunately the place was very crowded. And there was one guy on duty shouted on us. We know our fault but its not a major offense,  he didn't have to shout and humiliate us in front of the crowd. I knew his doing his line of work but is it right to humiliate us?|Manfred P|In Beton gegossenes Khatolisches religi√∂ses Dineyland.Catholic religious Disneyland cast in concrete.|Taylor S|Went here for a Religious Tourism and it was divine. The place is truly solemn and reverent. Feels like that any prayer of a sincere heart will be granted by this place. Visiting here on weekdays are much more preferable too as lesser people will be around.|Pio|simala has a big changes from those times i visit here with my family ,,it started just like very ordinary and so few people came here. .. and usually we wait at the gate when they open. . .now its like a tourist place to visit|Marty|So far üòâ I‚Äôve found 4 different names for this magnificent Cebu üáµüá≠ Religious Heritage Site ‚Ä¢ Simala Shrine ‚Ä¢ The Monastery Of The Holy Eucharist ‚Ä¢ Mama Mary Shrine Of Simala  ‚Ä¢ Birhen sa Simala For Simala Shrine ...

We rented a car at the airport and spent overnight at a resort in Mactan. The next day, with the help of Waze, we were able to reach the shrine, also known as the Monastery of the Holy Eucharist. The road leading to the shrine is called Mama Mary Sanctuary Road.As a Catholic, I consider this place as a pilgrim site rather than a tourist attraction. Since this is a religious place, proper dress code must be observed. Sleeveless clothes and shorts are not allowed.God bless us...|BennieGS2016|Just an hour or less from cebu city center. Faithfuls tambayan. Since it is a sacred Place, you ask by prayer and tru faith (geniune), your wish might be granted.|Clarizz|They have a strict compliance of proper dress codes. No short shorts and mini skirts, no sleeveless, no dresses above the knee, etc.People downstairs offer ""sarongs"" for rent. Also, arm yourself with your own umbrella, fan, and water. If you're visiting in ""hot & sunny hours"".There are umbrellas for rent downstairs too.God bless us all! üôè|NPLim|No matter how huge the church is, you can still hear the songs and prayers from the outside which will touch your heart. I feel blessed paying visit in this Church with my family. This can be one of your  faith enrichment destinations and you will be amazed by stories that made this Church where it is now.|Brian Austin Cartin|As you stroll along the long bridge/hall towards the church, the view is mesmerizing and leaves you at awe! The devotion and dedication of the people to create a shrine or rather a palace for the Blessed Virgin Mary is indubious and should be commended. The scale of it is very large and you can see intricate details as you circle the area. Just enjoy the view and if you are willing, you can light up a candle and pray for the things you want.|marion93722|A testament of faith for the deep devout and solemn place. It‚Äôs amazingly huge. Well tucked in a local place. Be prepared to cover up but no worries for there are scarves for sale outside. Lots of mementos from miraculous healings. There is a route to kiss/pray to the virgin. A few minutes drive from Oslob for orientation on the location.|eLL|If you are religious person, you can go here (even if you're not). They so strict with dress code. No to dress or shorts above the knee (no to sando/tanks or slippers). It should be below the knee (decent) or you can bring shawl to cover. The place has great structure (still under repair). There's restroom inside the shrine which you will pay PHP 20.00 every time you go inside (lol).If you will go here for taking pictures/site seeing, 30 mins to an hour is ok since traveling from this place to main town is 1-2 hours and you need to stop over for ""PASALUBONG AREA"".|Eaten A|I‚Äôll acknowledge that some people might see it as an over glorified concrete souvenir shop.  It is mostly concrete and it does have a souvenir shop.That said the architecture is actually really interesting both inside and out.As a holy place it attracts many people to pray, very many, so if you want to pray at specific altar you will be lining up for a bit.The toilets there were very clean; The rest of the place offers lots of photo opportunities.There are Restaurants outside.I think it‚Äôs worth a visit, it would a shame to be in Cebu and miss out such a place in the world.|iankatipunan|Simala Shrine tour was really not part of our itinerary, but since my mother can't make a 30min walk to Kawasan falls, we went here instead.As we approach the gate, we were amazed as we see its castle-like facade, with arcaded corridors, aqueduct-like bridge connecting the garden to the shrine. The structure is also PWD-friendly, with ramps placed everywhere.Inside the shrine was a chapel, a praying area where colored candles lit, and a museum where testimonies of healed and answered prayers are kept and displayed.By the way, before going inside, bear in mind that proper attire is strictly implemented. Men wearing sando or tank top with shorts and slippers, and women wearing spaghetti straps, with very short shorts and slippers are not allowed. But if you're already worn shorts, don't worry! There are vendors outside the gate that will let you rent their shawls for Php20!If you're a Marian devotee and for Catholics who are ""sagrado katoliko"" I really recommend visiting the place. It will make your faith stronger as you see the evidences of the healed and answered prayers, and the people offering candles, roses and prayers to the pictures, portraits and sculptures of the Blessed Virgin Mary."
