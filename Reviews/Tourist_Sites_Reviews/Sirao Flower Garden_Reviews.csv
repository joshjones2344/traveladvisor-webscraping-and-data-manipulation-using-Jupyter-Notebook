Sirao Flower Garden,"Ina I|its a nice instagrammable place to visit, and about 20min away from marco polo hotel. there are no public transpo available in the area, so what I did (as recommended by the hotel staff!) was to hire a taxi to take us to sirao and take us back to hotel. overall, good experience!|YuppieLionheart|Travel time from Cebu City is less than one hour, the road to Sirao is quite challenging so that's another thrill. The entrance fee is 70 Pesos (As of May 2023). Expect a crowd and patience is a virtue if you want to have a picture with the famous golden hand. Actually, there's four of it. There are two huge golden hands, and two small ones. Since the line is quite long for the huge golden hands, I decided to just take a picture with the small ones as we still have another destination that day. I stood in line for almost 20 mins and yet, I'm not even close. Some takes more than 10 minutes in taking pictures. So imagine that? More than 10 minutes per person. During our time, most of the visitors are foreign, you can count with your hands how many are the Filipinos in line. I highly suggest that you make this as your last destination so you can spend all the time here and you won't have to hurry because you still have another place to go but it would be much better if there's someone who facilitates to ensure that a guest won't spend too much time to consider also there are a lot of other guests waiting for their turn. Also, there's a restroom in the area but in the far end of the garden. Before you exit, you can buy some souvenirs. Outside the garden, you can try out the smoked banana cue, buko juice and other meriendas available.|Len Mian|This garden also nicknamed the Amsterdam of Cebu, is an Instagram paradise.   Very nice views and flowers in the high country.  Lots of elevation climbing by car to get to this spot.  The trip is worth it.|DrNBA|One of the most beautiful views in Cebu! This Garden was filled with wonderfully bloomed flowers, areas to take pictures and most important, the mountains! Great creation on the mountainside!|joycehehe|A long drive from Mactan- more than 1hr. View is beautiful with fresh flowers. However, hard to walk to. Place is not accessible at all via wheel chair and is not senior-citizen friendly at all.Still worth the long drive for me. Very picturesque. Suggest to go early morning or late afternoon because the place has no shade at all.|penelope j|Beautiful flowers and set up. However, the place was not accessible. It‚Äôs a bit of a drive from the city of Cebu. The road was a little bit treacherous going there, requiring you to have a great driver. Some areas are a bit rundown. All in all the experience was good.|Aurora_Nomad|Visited with co-workers, and thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful garden, and plenty of opportunities to take memorable photos (some are cheesy, but the hands snd some other ones were enjoyable). It is a drive from Cebu city (took us some 40mins), but we all liked it. Fun fact: check out the Mickey Mouse fruit (not edible, but fun looking).|Sharon Rogers|This will always be such a wonderful memory of my trip to the Phillipines. So cleverly put together, gorgeous views and the gardens tendered to so beautifully. The sculptures the whole experience is not to miss 12 out of 10 from me. Definately worth the visit.üôè‚ù§Ô∏è|Chevy|Perfect venue for pictorial. All the spots are eye candy and amazing to capture that will contribute to making a memorable experience.|Irish Mae|we are a bit disappointed when we went there since there are less flowers due to typhoon odette, We did not able to experience and see the beautiful scenery of siarao garden based on pictures. But it is understandable due to typhoon odette.We will be back here this coming March or April, and as per our tour agency, this is the perfect time to grow back the flowers.|TengCorrea|I learned this just now but apparently, there are two Sirao gardens in Cebu and this one is for Sirao Pictorial Garden and Camping Site (PGCS). It's a small place. where there are several structures where one can pose for photos against lovely beautiful mountainous backdrop. Most famous of which are the giant hands. There are some flower beds as well. If you're worried about the heat, there are huts or shaded areas where you can rest for a bit. Located about 45mins fr Cebu City, one can take habal-habal from in front of JY Square Mall. You can negotiate but got mine for Php400. There's an additional fee if driver to come in and take your photos. Other sites to visit near area are Temple of Leah, Tops and Little Kyoto. Best to come in the morning because around noon, it can get crowded that people take turns with the more popular pictorial sites. Entrance fee at 60 pesos. There's a small shop near the entrance that sells drinks and snacks as well as souvenirs. Note though that they don't allow visitors to bring water bottles inside.|Junlen Antonio|When my family and I decided to visit Cebu we started looking for some attractions to visit then we stumbled upon a post about Sirao Garden. The photos are just so beautiful and so we made sure to check out the place and it is indeed beautiful. The flowers are so colorful it‚Äôs like it would make you feel so happy inside by seeing those vibrant colors. The view is so breathtaking as well I couldn‚Äôt help but appreciate and stare at it because it is just so peaceful. I am just so happy that my family and I visited this place and we would surely go back soon.|irenevff|because of the pandemic, i find it fortunate that there was not a crowd flocking this garden in the mountainous area of the city. it was a splendid sight showcasing plants and flowers of various colors with a little feel of amsterdam. the windmills are an eye candy. smelling the flora is effortless. the sweet scents emanating from the flowers can reach your nostrils even when you are wearing face mask & shields. there was strictly a 'no touch' sign in every corner for the safety of both plants and guests.for a measly fee of Php60, you can have the entire garden for yourself, for as long as you would want to stay.|Sazeena N|Very pretty place with a view. The theme of the garden is as the name says, Amsterdam. I loved the miniatures, view and the garden itself. It can be crowded as it is a good place for photographers, Instagrammers, selfie takers.|Nico Samneil Sy Salado|Place not yet fully developed but are already charging php100 for an entrance. If you are flower/plant lover then maybe you might enjoy here. Place has few flowers/plants to get amazed to. Parking is also difficult.|Francis_Elvis_Verdin|What a perfect place for an Instagramable, no need to use a filter because the place will give a perfect combination of shots.|Lala L|It is very amazing place.
