Sumilon Island,"Tibor A|30x3m long beach, without an option to see the inner part of the island without paying 2000-2500p fir the resirt part. We were there on Saturday when it was crowded with tourists. U can not buy anything on the beach, There is almost no shadow where u can sit not to get sunburned. The transport for 4 people was 1200p and 100p per head for environment. Waste of money and time.|Shaz E|We didn't have any tours booked as we wanted to explore on our own, but once we walked up the stairs for a bit (from the sandbar) and that was it. It was high tide so we couldn't sunbake. We snorkeled for a bit but the swell was bad.The package fee to get into the resort was like 2000peso or 2500 peso. The locals will try to rip you off for the price of the tuk tuk and boat trip. The starting price is 1000peso.  Overall, I didn't enjoy my time here and I honestly would give it a miss.|Paiis|Isn’t what is advertised at all! We expected a large beach area with a swimming area (the sea) instead we got there and we’ll there was steps up the island which you couldn’t go further as that was the resort and a mass amount of people sitting on the rocks as there was no beach area! Very poor.. we paid 1000php per person and it was a completely waste of money. We were told we could come back any time before 6pm and we were then told we had to leave at 3pm as that was the last boat. Because there wasn’t many people left waiting for boats. We’d have liked to see the sunset at least but we couldn’t. I wouldn’t recommend unless you stay at the resort.|uzmelissa|Sumilon island is a good choice to have rest and enjoy with sandy beach and perfect sea. The resort is well equipped for half day tour activities enough. Easy to reach and a good escape|paulatraveladdict|Not a relax exclusive place. Staff very friendly but not good management. Already had bad experience blue water resort macrame and here the same. A lot of day people making a lot of noise under plastic tents. Marked swimming place with big boat in front making a lot of noise. No drinks after 21.00, no minibar, they don’t allow drinks from Cebu. No cushion on beds, not relax. Restaurant is nice but no good food. Only pizza (they ran out of pizza first night), burger en Filipino food (which we had before so much better for so much less). No seafood… no bar. No daily cleaning. Over crowded beach. If you want a nice place go to the atmosphere resort in Dauin. Prices same but 10 times better!|Evelin M|It’s just a small sandbar with a bunch of seashells that makes it uncomfortable to walk. The typhoon affected the sandbar so it doesn’t look like the picture anymore. We did some snorkeling and it was ok but then we saw jellyfish and got out of the water. Overall, it was not worth going. The best part was pictures of the island from the boat ride.|Mandina81|Nothing to say but... Amazing! like literaly! So much fun and nature activities in here. Peaceful, clean and had a friendly staff. We're excited to post our group and of course each solo pictures! Amazing Cebu!|nitajuana|3 hours drive from Cebu City. When you reach the docking area you will check-in and they will give you an orientation - protocols, but no room keys yet. 10 minutes boat trip to the island. No fancy greetings, you have to walk all the way to their other check-in counter, where keys will be given when available.  Note: NOT a good place for elderly or PWD, lots of walking and stairs climbing. They have a golf cart that runs only up to 4pm, after that you have to walk from sand bar back to your room, a good 10 minute walk. They do not provide maps, so you have to navigate by yourself. The lagoon was pretty, but no one was on standby to help us there. Food was ok, during breakfast limited choices, no cereals for kids. Rooms are big but television and telephone is not working.The island is beautiful, serene but they can improve more on their service and amenities.|Pio|i was with my coworkers here very beautiful island and we have a peaceful vacation here . .i highly recommend this place .|MJ Tups|Good day, I would like to ask if there is a hotel nearby Tan-awan Oslob Cebu, accomodating for boat rent in going to Sumilon island? How much is the boat rent if there is?"
