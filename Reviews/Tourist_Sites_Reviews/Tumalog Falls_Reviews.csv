Tumalog Falls,"FSahertian|I saw a lot of beautiful waterfalls, but this was really am amazing waterfall! When we were there the only thing we said was omg what beautiful. It was nice you can also can swim in the very blue lagoon and of course standing under the waterfall... Love it!|Liau Yuan Wei|After the Oslob Whale Shark Tour, our tour guide Giselle brought us to Tumalog Falls, which is a short drive from there. Note that 4-wheels will have stop at a certain point; then either you walk 3km to the falls, or you pay 150 pesos for motorbike ride to & fro the falls (You pay only when u made the return trip back from the falls). Reason is because the road ahead is too steep for 4-wheels to drive, only the motorbikes there have enough horsepower to carry tourists there. It’s a very beautiful fall and you can take lots of nice pictures with the waterfall! There’s also a small pond with small fishes, then you can dip your feet in for the fishes to bite off your dead skin from your feet! We spent a lot of time there posing for pictures (At least 45mins). Yet again, I think you should go early in morning to beat the crowd, and transport wise it’s best to have a private vehicle bringing you near the falls! We literally wore the swimwear we had from the whale shark tour to the falls, just like the other tourists we saw.|Summers On Wheels|The falls were actually better than expected. The water was cold but refreshing.Having to use a bike to get up the hill was annoying but it isn’t mandatory or even that expensive considering how steep that hill is.I highly recommend this place for family.Don’t plan on spending more than 1-2 hours here.|Trang N|This is a beautiful water fall, although it is not that big but I love it. Water is so nice, I stood right under the stream and felt so rejuvenated. I hiked up and down the road, great exercise too|L11|Beautiful falls which are down a very steep hill - cars can’t go down it so there are lots of motorbikes waiting to take you down and up for 50 pesos each way. You can walk like we did which isn’t that bad. The falls are beautiful and weren’t too busy when we visited. You are able to swim in the pool - it is rather cold! Very impressive size and natural beauty. Not too developed which is good to see.|Mark K|it's a bit of a hike to go see, but so worth it to swim and see how beautiful these falls our. We took a van and have about 15+ family members to enjoy it.|uzmelissa|One of the best waterfalls I'have seen before and it's a bonus to swim inside, no need do canyonering just you're there in couple minutes. Easy to visit place, and it takes you from this world.|joywu1001|The most magnificent waterfall I have ever seen! The whole place reminded me of scenes from Avatar! You can get in the water if you want, but it was a bit chilly for me. Bring a towel if you plan to get wet. It's just 10 minutes from the Oslob whale sharks, and no walking required at all! The locals take you right to the waterfall on motorbike (around 5 minutes) from the parking area. Must go if in the area!!!|Traveling Ammonite|Really fun, scenic waterfalls that you could spend fifteen minutes or an hour in, depending on how you feel. I sat here for an hour, resting my legs in the water or playing in the waterfall. It was absolutely lovely. I was able to catch it when it was super busy, and another time when I was one of the only people there.|Rob B|Our family and kids used to take all of our visitors to this place right after the finished seeing the whale sharks in Oslob. But at some point before the pandemic the water flow was down to nothing and it was not a great place to visit. Now however, all that has changed for the better. The water flow is not only great it's exceptional making for a super high, huge and majestic waterfall. It's a little strong to stand directly under the main falls but there are other smaller ones adjacent you can enjoy on your body.  The falls are breathtaking and a true prize in nature. Anyone going to see the whale sharks MUST make a side trip here. In addition to the water falls the area in general is well maintained and they are improving and beautifying the facilities there. You will need to take a motorcycle down to the falls and up from the falls as the roads are steep canyons and they really shouldn't allow cars there to preserve this place a a sanctuary. Although the motorcycle ride was a bit of a thrill ride all by itself it was well organized and inexpensive transportation.  Don't walk it, going down is fine but going up may kill you lol.  As a local, I am impressed and excited for the efforts of restoration and organization that it has undergone. It was much needed to preserve the magnificence of this place."
