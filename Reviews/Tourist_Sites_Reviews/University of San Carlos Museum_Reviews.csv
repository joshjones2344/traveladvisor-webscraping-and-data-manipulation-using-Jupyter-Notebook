University of San Carlos Museum,"Alexia T|The university museum is beautifully in order arranged. The museum has exhibits like Saint exhibits, chinaware, and old swords..|Francis Demetri A|The museum's collection lacks depth and fails to provide a cohesive narrative. The artworks on display are limited and lack notable pieces that would captivate art enthusiasts. The artifacts, while representing different periods, lack proper contextualization, leaving visitors confused about their significance.|Shiloah Brook M|The museum offered a captivating experience with its extensive collection of interesting artifacts and pieces. Visitors were engaged through interactive activities, such as the paint wall, which added a creative dimension to the visit. Although not as accessible as other museums, likely due to its affiliation with a school, the museum's hidden location added to its charm and exclusivity. Despite the slight challenge in finding it, the effort was well worth it for the unique and diverse cultural heritage showcased within. Overall, this museum is a must-visit for those seeking to uncover hidden gems and embark on a delightful journey through history and art.|Unoh Borbajo|The museum's displays cover a diverse range of topics, including anthropology, natural history, fine arts, and archaeology. Visitors can view historic artifacts, including ceramics, utensils, and jewelry, which provide a peek into the Philippines' pre-colonial history. Additionally, there are works of religious art and colonial-era art in the collection that demonstrate the impact of Spanish colonization on the local artistic traditions.Also, I loved that we were able to visit the University of San Carlos - Main Campus as me and my friends who visited are Carolinians that study at Talamban Campus. It was great to know our institution offers this kind of experience where we would be taken back in time and learn more about the world around us.|Tristan Ybanez|Thanks to our school requirement, I recently had the pleasure of visiting a museum. and I must say the experience was truly fascinating and enlightening. From the moment I entered, I was transported to a world of history, art and culture. The museum was like no other, It was well lit, clean, and modern. and as much as I hate to admit it, but I really am not a fan of museums, however, This museum was just inviting me to indulge in the history, and learn. I left the museum in awe and inspiration! I wholeheartedly recommend visiting this musem|Isabella M|The exhibits themselves were interesting but the highlight was definitely the collection of old saint figures. The venue itself is clean, well-lit, and modern looking compared to the anthropological and animal exhibit. There is a wide array of items to look at so it feels worth the relatively cheap price, even better if you are a USC student as admission is free.|Romar John C|The museum has its modern approach in displaying significant relics, artifacts, and even organisms in the rich history of the Philippines.|Tel G|Overall, the establishment was well kept and the artifacts are well maintained with corresponding labels so if you didnâ€™t have anyone to walk you through the museum you could still immerse yourself by reading those attachments.|Joel V|As a Carolinian myself, I was able to enjoy the museum visit. It was the first time I was able to go and I appreciate USC very much that they were able to hold such treasures and heritage. As a Filipino youth, I was able to take myself back in the past from the precolonial, indigenous roots to the more contemporary. USC upholds the importance of history and that is shown how the museum is well-curated. I loved the experience as it made me realize the significance of honoring the Filipino roots from the preserved wares for daily living, religious artifacts during the colonial period, to indigenous materials and heritage, revolutionary traditions, and even the fauna of the Philippine wild. It was a very insightful, amusing experience.|Ly G|The place has so much displays that tells a lot about the history of the Philippines, particularly its ethnic people and their lives, some ancient displays of Christian symbols as well as some of the ancient fauna found in the Philippines and across worldwide."
