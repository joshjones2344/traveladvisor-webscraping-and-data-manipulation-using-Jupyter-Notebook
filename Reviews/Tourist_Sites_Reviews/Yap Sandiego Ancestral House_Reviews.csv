Yap Sandiego Ancestral House,"IOLANDA PRISCIL... Y|I'm proud to be a YAP because of my father, and my Chinese Ancestor. I may not the only 1, but many.|Simon C|Apparently, this is the oldest Chinese house in Cebu and I was told “most is original”.  I am sceptical, the floorboards like more like 35 years old not 350 and nails were not around in the 1670s.  The owners, I mam told,  stay at weekends, but hard to see quite where since their bedroom looked very unoccupied. One uncomfortable moment was in the garden where there is a harpist, who for a few peso, will play a little, at which three young children- aged between 4-7, dressed in traditional dress wake up (or are woken) from dozing in a nearby room and rush to perform a series of whirls and swirls.  They don’t look happy and I felt this bordered on child abuse.  The harpist told me these were his children, so does this make it ok?|alwaystravelsf|Wasn’t expecting much but I have to admit it was fascinating to see such an old house and being able to walk around and they even allow you to sit on furniture and touch some artifacts.  Just be respectful as it’s old.  The upstairs was cool and the bedroom is there where apparently the owners stay on weekends.  An old man was playing an old Harp and beautiful song, Fools Rush In by Elvis.|Escapementality|According to the Guide to the Philippines website, this house is not only one of the oldest in the Philippines and home to the family who helped found Cebu's Sinulog festival, but perhaps the first Chinese house built outside of China.Why such a low score for such a historic place. then?Because as a historical experience, which the Yap San Diego Ancestral House is billed as, it fails to educate the visitor at all. We visited hoping to learn something about the multicultural history of Cebu, but what little we did learn came from looking things up online after the fact.I couldn't help but compare this house to another old house that we visited nearby later in the day, the Casa Gorordo museum. While the Yap San Diego house is much older, Casa Gorordo does a far better job of communicating its history to visitors, with interactive screens, and tablet-based audiovisual tours included in the ticket price.Judging by past reviews, it appears that there used to be costumed tour guides to help people understand the property, but we saw no-one and no mention of any such service. It's incredible to me that both Yap San Diego and Gorordo charge the same 100 peso entry fee when YSD is so much smaller, less preserved, and provides no services to guests, at least when we visited.While I understand that the Yap San Diego house may not have the same funding as Casa Gorordo, surely a photocopied info sheet could be included with the admission. Or at a minimum. signs to help visitors understand the significance of the items in the house. That being said, I question the significance of many of the items. Every room is full of things, many arranged in strange ways (like a ceramic baby Jesus and a stack of abacuses sitting on an old chair). Some seem quite old, others much more modern. And there are no instructions requesting visitors refrain from touching the items or using the furniture. In fact, the majority of visitors appeared to be using the house as a backdrop for selfies, where they could sit in an antique chair by a window, or pretend to have afternoon tea with old dishes. From the people hawking souvenirs outside to the buskers inside. the house has more of a feeling of a tourist trap than a place designed with the history lover or cultural preservation in mind.In short, if you are just looking for a place to take some photos, the Yap San Diego house will probably suit your needs. If you are looking to learn about the history and culture of Cebu, you should either do a lot of research beforehand. or better yet, go to Casa Gorordo instead of you are short on time. It's a real shame, as obviously, the time periods and cultural backgrounds represented by these two houses are quite different, but unless the Yap San Diego Ancestral House takes some steps to educate visitors, I can't really recommend it as a place to learn more about Cebu, at least on its own. If you have ample time, it's a decent add-on to Casa Gorordo, since it's so close by. I'd recommend asking if there are guides available. All the staff there did was take our money, no information was provided.|loo c|The Yap-Sandiego Ancestral House is a must-visit heritage site in Cebu City. It offers a glimpse into the traditional Chinese-Filipino lifestyle during the Spanish colonial period. The house is well-preserved and showcases traditional architecture, antique furniture, pottery, and artwork. The porcelain and ceramic plates on the walls are a highlight. Guided tours are available to visitors, and the house's rich history and cultural significance make it a worthwhile stop for history and architecture buffs alike. The location in the Parian district adds to the charm of the attraction.|Czar Emmanuel|This ancestral house dating back to the 17th century is one of the main tourist attractions in Cebu City. It is located in the old Parian district of the city and is a silent witness to many historical events of the Filipino people. Inside you'll find lots of antiques. The house has two floors. The second floor is particularly interesting because of its old rooms (bedrooms, dining room, sala, etc.). Visiting this place is like travelling back in time. It is best to have a tour guide to explain to you the house's history, architecture, and the way people lived during that time.|Oscardog16|The ground floor reeked of urine. They had 2 toilets for public use but they stunk and it wafted all though the house. Upstairs was just a collection of crockery  and furniture. The displays exhibited no historical significance. Much lace to do about nothing.  If you bother to go in that is what you will see, lace adorning the tables, the window frames and the door arches. This is once you dodge the street hawkers that will not accept no for an answer. Not a place that is worth a stop.|Paz S|I visited this place in 2018 with my significant other and my daughter. The vibe was okay until we stepped into one of the bedroom. I think the house was haunted. It felt like we were not welcome in that room. I couldn’t breathe and felt uneasy, so we left.|Reslimpan|An old house with owners suffering from being hoarders, well perhaps an exaggeration but there is no rhyme or reason for the interior decoration, it has just been pieced together randomly.|Traveling Ammonite|Every single website on this place says the entrance fee is 50 Php per person, but they charged 100 per person in our group. They insisted ""iT wAs ChAnGeD iN SePtEmBeR lolol"" but failed to produce any source - even on their own website, that they themselves directed us to -  that mentioned this price change. Then they said ""Oh bUt iT wAs aNNouNcEd oN FaCeBoOk"" which, after checking out their Facebook, also wasn't true, and again they failed to produce proof that the price was raised to 100 per person.Foreigners beware, these guys are shady as hell and don't even know how to scam properly|Glenn W|The house structure is amazing enough but to add to that the house is jam packed with various collectables no doubt gathered by the family over a considerable period of time. The house is still used by the family, apparently. I think it is worth the admission price.|richj65|Esthetically pleasing interior but cramped  and overprised. The rudeness of the staff also does not help. Take a look from the outside but keep going to another site.|Agot76|This trip was actually a back-up plan because the neighboring museum was closed for renovation. We were so glad we did this. Not only the tour guide was knowledgeable enough but he was also a good choreographer/photographer for our group. He took the time to explain the history of the place and not only that, he shared his talent for photography! The pictures were wonderful! Highly recommend it.|Colleen F|I really enjoyed a stroll around this house looking at all of the antiques. The staff is friendly and the furniture was lovely. It really does take you back in time. It is only 50 Pesos, so great value for money too. To note, I've seen some reviews from people complaining about the hot and stuffy interior and people should accept that this is the Philippines and there is no aircon inside the venue, so it is very hot and humid inside, as is to be expected.|neil5050|A fantastic experience with private tour guide. He knew everything about the house and was also a great photographer taking snaps of us posing in old day poses.I’m sorry I forgot his name but he is worth it and make sure you repay his great tour at the end.A must do in Cebu!!|TengCorrea|One of the oldest houses in the Philippines at 300 years, this ancenstral home stays strong as it is has been lived in and taken care of through 10 generations. Its original structure of wood, coral stones held together by egg yolks and red clay roof is retained at more than 90%.Aside from this structure and antique items on display, what's more lovely in this place is its story which the caretaker would be glad to share to you as you walk around. I like best its generosity that you can almost feel how its owners lived as you visit its various areas (including a functional bedroom). There are photos everywhere which give the feeling that you know them.On the practical end, with an entrance fee of Php50, you can roam freely at your pace, take snaps, even sit on chairs. Just make sure to not break any stuff.It is situated in the city near other sites like Casa Gorordo, heritage monument, Magellan's Cross and Basilica.|Francis_Elvis_Verdin|The historic residence was constructed in the 17th-century featuring hand-carved furniture, art & a garden.|Citra Jatmiko|The house was very “eye catching” so that you can easily spotted its building from the main street as you have to park your vehicle in another side of the street, since the main street was a bit narrow. There were so many Philippines’ flags and decorations over the house. There were also many signs and information boards in front of the House. There's a tour guide who'll tell the stories about the house comprehensively and very detailed. The house has two floors, while on first floor was all the main rooms, like family room, dining room, kitchen, and storage for all the stuffs. On the second floor, you will just find the bedrooms, main bedroom and other functional rooms. There's a beautiful mini garden outside the house, located at the backside of the house. Worth to visit, so far... especially for those ancient geeks and historical things' nerds.|Carlos Salinas|If you want to understand the history of this house, make sure to bring a tourist guide or make your own research. Very interesting place full with antique furniture.|Michael H|Think Haw Par Villa rather than National Trust . Costumed room guides and overly packed spaces gave a less than convincing experience of colonial Cebu life. Might keep youngsters more engaged but rather oversold as a city highlite"
