lou t,"Michael at the bar as excellent.  The dood was excellent and decently priced. One of the best hotels in Mactan, Philippines.  Only 3 km from airport.  Much better stay than Waterfront.  I will be back."
Marie G,We had an amazing experience at this hotel. Everything was perfect and the staff made us feel welcomed and at home. Ralph and Rogel and Marco from housekeeping were incredibly helpful and thorough in keeping our room in pristine condition. Honey and Jessie from the restaurant provided exemplary service and the chefs prepared delicious meals every day. The beautiful beach is a huge bonus!😍 We are so impressed with the quality of this hotel and will definitely be coming back!

Trip27014832240,"My flight today was cancelled, but Philippine Airlines provided a free breakfast and free hotel stay. I am glad that Belmont Hotel staffs are very accommodating especially Ella who turned the situation into satisfying experience. She deserved a raise. I will consider this hotel in the future.  Thank you Ella for your warmth welcome."

Lito O,"First time to stay at Belmont Hotel-Mactan. Everyone was pleasant from dining staff to housekeeping. What stood out for me was Tina (dining area), her customer service was exceptional. We had a casual conversation after our breakfast and I mentioned that I was looking for “danggit” since it was not available then.  The next day, she approached me and remembered my cravings for “danggit” then she offered and requested their kitchen staff to cook “danggit” for me. Tina made the whole Belmont experience better for me."
Linsay C,"The rooms were really nice, especially the bed that gives you the most comfort feeling that you could get. The food was right on spot regarding with the taste. We commended their high quality Service both in accomodation and food."
jenny ann a,One of the best hotel for a friends staycation night. It’s very peaceful and the hotel staff are very accommodating. We’d also like to thank Ella for making our breakfast extra special. We are definitely going back for another staycation
Jerome S,The food is great. The hotel is super clean. We reaalyy had a good night stay. Had the time of our lives even when it's but one night. We stayed at ron 1010 the view was perfect. Cable tv was complete though there were slight glitches with the wifi access to the device. Swimming pol service is awesome. Staff was at the ready with towels on all tables. Overall the best part was ghe staff. Amenities were tops but I would say staff such as Ella Jagonase was very helpful. I'd say this is the best hotel by far in Cebu.
Albert Chan Paran,"When I got home yesterday after checking out and before I go to bed, it made me feel sad, and need some more time to adjust back to my regular-usual routine fresh from my Belmont Hotel Mactan New Year Birthday 2023 staycation mode after 5 days and 4 nights. I missed the luxurious experience of a brand-new hotel room only a Megaworld Hotels & Resorts newly soft-opened property can deliver.   The all-new amenities give me the kind of comfort, luxury, and relaxation where I instantly feel at home and that includes the supremely soft, large pillows and comforter around me in a cold chilly room on a most comfortable queen-size mattress. The housekeeping attendants always changed and replaced the bedding every single morning which made me feel very special and wonderfully taken care"
Christine Mae A,"We had a great time in Belmont. The service was fantastic, especially the bar staff Michael. He was so friendly and had done extra mile to ensure we are well looked after.

Abegail A,Belmont is probably an underrated hotel. It has the best amenities and the rooms are cozy you’d feel like ‘home away from home’. Perhaps the best compliment I would give is the courtesy of the staff. Surely a value we Filipinos are known for around the world. I wish I had stayed there longer. Truly a gem in Cebu!
Tourist45469782329,"Excellent service and accomodations all around, from its amenities to their very friendly and helpful staff. Our one day stay was due to our flight being delayed, but it truly was an amazing and an exceptionally wonderful experience. Our high commendation also goes to our server, Michael Romero, which was the one-in charge of the closing service on their world-class Restaurant. Kudos to you, sir for entertaining us on our lovely dinner! Overall, 5+ stars! Worth the stay!"

I salute these kind of employees as I, for one,  had also been a frontliner of the airport.   Thank you so much Belmont for serving your guests with excellence. Keep up the good work! Much love.   - JDC"
