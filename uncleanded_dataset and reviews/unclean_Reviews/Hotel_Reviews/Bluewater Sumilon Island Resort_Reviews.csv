M L,"One word to describe Bluewater Sumilon Island would be PARADISE! We were greeted by a mild-mannered receptionist (if i remember it right, Kevin) before we hopped on the boat.  Sit on the first row, if you wish to enjoy the water splashes.  We didn't mind as we were still wearing our swimmers from our whaleshark experience.  We got there about 1pm, the room was ready about 3pm, but no trouble, because we enjoyed alone time in the infinity pool, took a nap on the daybeds, enjoyed a ""must order"" halo halo on a buko, and fruit smoothies!  What makes this place awesome is the staff, from the pool guy who picks up every leaf falling on the water, to the porters who helped our bags, to the friendly people at the reception and the dining area, even the nice ladies at the Amuma lounge."
danilo b,It's lovely to be on this island for the first time. especially when I go scuba diving. I had a wonderful time. The staff is excellent. The food is delicious. I intend to return to this place. Sooner.
Mar D,"Kudos to all staff! Service is above and beyond.   We had a wonderful experience here at Bluewater Sumilon Island Resort. Villa rooms was perfect and private. The staff was amazing and went beyond to make our stay enjoyable. We definitely recommend this place.  Activities include everything worth seeing around the area. No worries if you can‚Äôt snorkel. They will teach you and provide equipment. The staff pays paramount attention to your safety. The coral reef is beautiful. Swimming and kayaking are fabulous. Worth every penny. Special thank you to Chef Jeffrey for the amazing Philippine cuisine. Also special thanks to Yuri (FO), Louie (HK), Roxxane (Dining), and to everyone who made it feel like paradise."
Dharma Raj D,"I availed there day pass package of Php2,000 and it comes with free boat transfer from the mainland to the island. Food was great specially the halo halo. I loved the natural landscape of the island and the crystal clear beach. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Approximately 3 hours drive from South Bus Terminal if you will ride the 3am bus trip ( Ceres Bus/ Yellow Bus)."
Claudette Pearl S,"Perfect for any celebrations, events and outings. üíô  I celebrated my birthday here in this beautiful island. My son enjoyed swimming at the sandbar and pools.

Lendie C,"A great place to stay to reconnect with nature. Solace and relaxing and my kids did enjoy the amenities. Very accommodating staff and they really lived the ""amuma cuture' as one of Filipino hospitality traits."
Arnel E,"Professional and Friendly Staff.  Epic Sunrise and Sunset Views ‚ù§Ô∏è Place for Foodies!   Great for Snorkeling and Diving Experience.  Overall 10/10  Recommended as one of the best Travel destination in Cebu, Philippines"
Chammy,Had a great time during my stay at Bluewater Sumilon. Celebrated valentines day there. Room was big facing the beautiful view of the ocean. Great spot for snorkeling and diving.. All the staff was very friendly and food was great.. Will definitely come back soon on our next vacation.
Prince Tisoy B,"A very beautiful and relaxing place to spend with your other half. Room accommodation, yummy food and excellent customer service completes our stay here on what we called paradise. A lot of activities, we have also enjoyed during our stay. Thanks to Bluewater Sumilon for a one of a kind experience."
Doris,"Amazing views everywhere on the island. Rooms were really clean , spacious and all ocean view. The bathroom was gigantic, modern with natural lighting from the huge sky lights. Wifi and A/C was flawless.  The main restaurant serving breakfast and dinner had great ambiance."
Sh8,"Such a lovely day trip we went again for a second day. The snorkeling here is great so I can only imagine the dive would be too. You can pay to use the resort for the day and you get access to the beach, swimming pools, buffet lunch, equipment. You can also trek or ride bikes here. You can also just pay to visit the sand bar to swim too."
Selina M,"I had heard a lot about this resort and had originally planned a day trip, last minute we decided to spend one night.   The property and the room were amazing! The views are obviously incredible all around because it's an island of it's own. We also did some snorkeling off the coast which, although was beautiful, was not regulated to standards I would prefer. You can literally walk on the coral and destroy it as much as your heart desires.   The hotel itself was over-priced for what was offered. The service was also lacking. We had just come off of four days spent traveling around the Philippines islands staying in places much cheaper, with much less to offer, with way better customer service. There were multiple times we had to wait 10+ minutes for drinks when we were the only"
Kim J,I would like to commend all the staff of Bluewater Sumilon Island Resort. I had a great stay and the food was superb. The view of the place is so amazing. I felt like I'm in paradise. Thank you Bluewater Sumilon!
Agnes R,"It was the most enjoyable island visit. I brought my whole family, it was our first stop from a very long flight..perfect to relax and the food was superb! The boat ride to the island was good. My kids had a great experience of kayaking and fishing at their own pier. The beach was great.. the water condition was a bit rough at that time, but we had fun at their pool. I was a bit disappointed when we could not gone to the sand bar, the weather was not nice.. but I will definitely come back in this island of paradise. I would highly recommend bluewaters sumilon island to my friends."
Shee Rah,"A perfect hideaway for relaxation. We love the serenity of the place, the people there were very friendly and courteous and the food was consistently delicious. Beautiful scenery, peaceful ambiance. Great place to relax and fall in love."
Joy_n,"This place is simply excellent. This island resort offers everything that a 5 star resort provides but at the same time experiencing the serenity and calmness of true nature. From the front desk manager Ms. Elvie, to All her staff, spoils guests by providing a personalized touch to their service. Both restaurants found at the resort have affordable prices and good food. The three days we spent here went by very quickly because of the various nature inspired activities. No complaints here. Just a big thank you. And we will surely come back next year. I hope that other tourists can discover the beauty and tranquility of this island  No need to go further."
Arnoud,"Yes it is expensive, but yes it is a wonderful place to relax.   The staff are friendly and welcoming, the rooms are comfortable and clean, and there are plenty of activities such as fishing, kayaking, pedal boats at the lagoon and snorkeling on different sides of the island. We stayed here for two nights with our two children (8 and 5 years old) and we never got bored. There is a separate infinity swimming pool for in-house guests, and another swimming pool for all guests.   The food is fine: they have the best club sandwich we have ever tasted in Asia and every evening there is a themed dinner buffet. We had China and Seafood: the first we found better and tastier than the second, but it looked super good and well cared for.   All in all quality for money, especially when you"
Dalamar66,"Food was great, ceviche, sushi, seafood... awesome views and many things to do, from kayaking to fishing and of course snorqueling around the sandbar.  It is well worth it the price tag, looking forward to repeat!"
Stella D,"Bluewater Sumilon Island Resort did not disappoint! From beginning to end, our stay was delightful. The staff was very accommodating and very pleasant. The food was fantastic. The place was very clean and well maintained. Did not expect it for a big island resort but they did a pretty good job. The views from the island are unbelievable, the sand bar was picture perfect, the activities are available if you want to leave a island and be adventurous. I highly recommend staying here if you want a true R and R."
Kat,"This place is amazing! It‚Äôs not the techiest place in terms of keycards and such but the internet is fast. My husband works online doing videos and the internet did not disappoint. Now on to the best bits...  1. Room was so spacious and comfortable. The bathroom is on a whole other level. It‚Äôs a room all on it‚Äôs own. It seemed to me that all the rooms have a sea view. Or at least most of them. It can comfortably fit a family of 6 with extra mattresses. But is incredibly spacious for 4. The beds were so comfortable and the bathroom had a bidet! If you are looking for razors, bring your own. :)  2. The amenities/facilities are simply breathtaking and wonderful to be a part of. Sumilon island is a marine sanctuary. They have activities that promote this. So much to do with a"
Lantmanna,"We Analyn and I took 2 nights here at the vila 15.... good location and near the beach on the island.....but so far it‚Äôs good until we sitting down for dinner... it‚Äôs a buffet and lots of Choices..... but unfortunately the cook/chefs has make mistakes of NOT using salt/pepper even the shrimp does not taste...... bad, really bad.....so plymake you‚Äôre choices....."
LightPacker824505,Pros - picture postcard blue clear waters + the sandbar.  - Not many chalets so a good get away from the crowd - Reasonable value for what you get  Cons - Day travellers but that's what helps to sustain the reasonable price you pay while staying at BW Sumilon - Low numbers of pax also means low variety of food during buffet time.  All part of the deal
Shebenlee,"Absolutely loved my stay here. We did the glamping. It was amazing. We had the whole beach to ourselves. The food was spectacular, buffet breakfast was the best. We had our own private dinner for two. The staff were very friendly and accommodating to any needs you might have. The snorkeling was really beautiful, so many beautiful fish and corals. It truly was an amazing experience. I hope to come back again one day."
Jan,Waters are clear and blue. Marine life not bad if u snorkel. The sand bar is nice but crowded with day travelers. The resort is value for money as they include 2 way transfer n ferry.  The 4 hours car ride from airport is worth the experience.
wanita.banana,"Living the island at its finest here. Picturesque Scenery was in every corner. The sandbar is definitely a must experience here. Its very fine white sands was also very enticing. The staffs are very polite, too."
Nhagz,"Last December of 2018,we went to Bluewater Sumilon Island with some of my blogger and media friends. We stayed their spacious room and the ambience was really good. The vibe outside is stunning. Their food was great and the staffs are truly well-trained. We enjoyed so much with our stay at the resort."
richie880,"We join the day tour.  Price has increase to 2500 pesos either day of the year, be it weekends or holiday.  The boat arrived at the sand bar, the sand bar is for all people, don‚Äôt expect it to be a private property of the hotel. Day trippers comes in and out from their boat.  From the sand bar you need to go up to reach the resort.  They have a golf cart waiting for you to take you to their property.  From there you need to walk down to reach the main activity center, swimming fall, main dining hall, lagoon , beaches is not that swimmable in this area, your better off swimming in the sand bar area.  Lunch menu is so so, more on meat.    The services of the staff is good here, that‚Äôs the only good point.  Will I come back?  No, once is enough for this place."
happy traveler,"Worth the long travel. Waves at the private beach were too strong due to the weather, but the water around the sandbar was beautiful and there were plenty of things to do. The island is beautiful, with lots of visiting baby sharks. Service is excellent. Friendly, accommodating staff. Special thank you to Chef, who fixed us lunch on a very, very short notice!"
EndlessTravels,Apart from the mass of day trippers on island it‚Äôs a fantastic and beautiful spot to stay. The scenery is picturesque and the resort looks after you very well. Would recommend to my friends without a hesitation
MeyaTM,"Came to this place wth my hubby and kid,to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  From their holding area in the mainland til every staff we met in the resort, everyone had been so courteous and always on standby to assist u on ur needs..plus they provide not just the usual staff guest convo..but i say personalized convo snce most of them would proactively give u info and details so ul have a better idea how to have an awesome resort experience..buffet food is superb,worth the price..the infinity pool for in-house guest needed some repainting, but it has the most picture-perfect view..deluxe and premier deluxe rooms have beautiful view.  We surely would come back to this place, coz this d only resort we visited by far where we felt much privacy and treated fairly well (although"
