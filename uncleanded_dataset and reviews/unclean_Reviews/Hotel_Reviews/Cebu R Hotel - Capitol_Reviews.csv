wavedxb,"Despite being a small hotel, the rooms were clean and comfortable, adequate for the price you pay.   Toilet has hot and cold with bidet. location is perfect with close proximity to coffeeshop, atm and bank, hospital and massage center. if you craving for grilled foods, there are 2 restaurant next to the hotel.  Convenient store like 7 eleven is close by, its near to Capitol Hall.  Around 20 minutes to Ayala Center Mall if no heavy traffic.  Check in -in date| 25 Apr - 01 May 2022"
LolaGo1,"Feeling tired and hot when I reached this hotel, I became upset when they wouldt NOT give me the applicable discounts! All the  other 5 hotels I had previously visited during these trips to the Visayas gave me 20 % discount! I was told to discuss this with Booking.com where I booked my 3-nights stay here.  My mood changed when I saw my modern and clean room located at the 4th Floor. The floor is made of hard wood and beddings appeared newish. There are 2 Free bottles waiting for me and the refrigerator has soft drinks and water for sale. Wifi is fast and there is hot water in the shower.  Korean Air CANCELLED FLIGHTS: The Front Desk personnel named Sam and June helped me get new flights from Manila to Washington, DC. It took us almost 3 hours  to iron this out, but they both"
Kazylaz,"Good place for overnighting in the city. Very good food in the restaurant, friendly staff, adequate room facilities. Unfortunately air conditioning not brilliant In our room which gave us a couple of sweaty nights."
guillermo,"Located near the Cebu Capitol site, this is one of the better budget hotel I have experience. The facilities are very good, clean and convenient. The rooms are bigger, good bed and reasonable food. Service are very satisfactory. Conviently located in the old area of Cebu, but accessible to most destinations. Recommended"
Czar Emmanuel,"It was my second time to stay at this hotel. The first time was way back in 2012. And it doesn't disappoint. The staff is still friendly and accommodating. Room is clean, quiet, equipped with the basic facilities I needed (AC, TV with cable channels, private toilet and shower room with hot water, a safety box, a fridge, etc.). Complimentary breakfast is good, and so forth. But what I really like about this hotel is its location. It's just a stone's throw away from the city Capitol, bars, restaurants, shopping malls, convenience stores, etc. It is also very accessible to both private and public means of transportation. Thumbs up!"
Marielle D,"Stayed here last April 1&2, 2019, and I must say that my family, and I were satisfied.  Overall Satisfaction (5-point rating scale): Staff: 4 - accommodating, and friendly. We arrived at past 7:00 in the evening, yet the front desk personnel didn't give a hint of tiredness. Room: 4.5 - clean sheets, clean room, clean bathroom, and comfortable bed&pillow. Also, the corridor is clean. Price: not that sure about it since we booked using a travel agency. But when I searched the price for the room we had, I must say that it was affordable for the comfort we just experienced so I'm giving it a points of 4. Place: 4 - located within the heart of Cebu City, it was accessible in all commercial establishments. Food: 3 - we had to leave early (5 or 6 am) so they only gave us bread with"
UKMALETRAVELLER,"Very pleasant hotel with friendly staf. Very spacious, clean room - with extremely comfortable bed. Receptionist also arranged an amazing half-day tour for me. Included breakfast and was good value for money."
Gail the Whale,"My husband and I stayed here 2 nights. Our room was spacious, clean and quiet. The hotel is a little distant from the main sights, but only a short 110 peso taxi ride to the main attractions like the Bascillica El Niño. The staff were courteous. The breakfast food was very limited. We would also have liked open access to water, rather than having to keep buying more and more plastic bottles. It was lovely to have a decent, powerful hot shower after some of the places we have stayed so far."
George,"I just spent one week at this hotel in Cebu, and I can say that it is a good value for money, quiet and clean. I would recommend this hotel, even though it doesn't have a swimming pool. But you can always take a day pass to another hotel with a swimming pool, which is more fun because you always explore more and more..."
rose168_11,"We were originally booked at Cebu R Mabolo. When we arrived at the hotel, the elevator was under repair so they made arrangement to transfer our booking to Cebu R Capitol. Upon arrival, we were served refreshing drinks which was a pleasant surprise. We only booked a standard twin room but they upgraded our accommodation to a deluxe room. The room was very clean and so spacious because it was good for 4 persons. The staff at this hotel were very friendly and helpful. Special mention must be made for the guard because he was very helpful when we needed taxi. He also made an effort to assist my elderly father when disembarking from the taxi. The set breakfast, included in the room rate, was very good. When my Cebuano nephews visited us at the hotel, I treated them to the set"
Michelle G Bañez,"If you are looking for a place to stay at the center of Cebu city on a limited amount of funds, this is a place for you. Finalist as the Best budget hotel in Cebu, Cebu R Hotel really is easy in the pocket. Surrounded by several food establishments, you will never go hungry and at the right price. Just a short walk away from Cebu provincial Capitol. We booked a standard room but to our surprise, we were upgraded to a suite room for no extra charge. I think it's because they have overbooked the standard rooms. (lucky!) The room is spacious though our bed is next to a pillar so it seemed cramped. The aircon was dripping and it made our blanket wet. :( The members of the staff are friendly and accommodating. Their breakfast meal was just right to start your day. I will definitely"
Patrick S,"There are now two different branches of the Cebu R Hotel, but for some reason only one of them is listed here. I stayed at the Capitol branch in the heart of Uptown Cebu City on 3 different occasions, as I was using the city as a home base to visit Bohol, Negros, and Bantayan Island. And at 950 pesos per night, this is a real bargain!  Don't know if it's because I was a nice and friendly guest, but they upgraded me to a suite for my first stay, and then to a Deluxe room for my next two stays, free of charge and without my asking! So I was very happy about that!  Both the suite and the room showed a bit more wear and tear than what you can see on the photos posted on their website. Still, in that price range, it remains a good budget option. Both rooms were quite spacious, with a"
travel_time,"I missed my flight and had to rebook it for another day so I searched for a bufget friendly accomodation and the cab driver suggested Cebu R Hotel. The standard room was 950 php but upon checking in I was upgraded to a suite which was really nice. Breakfast was free. A decent hotel with hot shower, cable, wifi and selcome drinks when you check in. I had a pretty comfortable stay. I will reccomend this if you are not looking for luxury and just a place to stay."
londonmammal,"Everything is about this hotel is very average except for the staff, who are very friendly and try to be very helpful, even though they often fall short of actually being helpful.  Location, is average, a short walk from most places in uptown. Breakfast was Ok - nothing great, but acceptable Hotel was fine for a budget hotel Room was fine - on the ground floor with no view, but wifi was good, shower good and bed comfortable.  However - tried to charge me for some laundry that they didnt do (washing machine wasnt even working so i was told - so not sure how they thought they could charge me for doing laundry!). If you want a dash of milk in tea  - as is standard for the UK, you get charged extra for milk being a drink itself.  However, they tried hard, and all staff were always"
LakwatSario,"When my Mom and Dad visited me early January 2015, we stayed in Cebu R Hotel Mabolo --- the newest in the district. I fondly try the newest around me.  The ferry from our hometown, Dapitan City, arrived around 6AM. We went to the hotel right away. We were assisted by April at the reception. She's sweet and accommodating. The check in was quick and we were given an early check in. A glass of cold refreshment was also offered. They have no bellman. But, a trainee assisted us with our luggage and directed us to our room.  We were in Room 508. It was located in the corner of the floor. It was facing the southern part of Cebu City. The room was cleaned keenly. It has a warm and cold shower. They are using key card system. One cool thing this hotel possesses. The mini bar has"
natalie M,"We were really pleased with this hotel, good value for money ,  rooms are clean, bathroom is fine, central location and the food (cheeseburger for the evening and French toast in the morning) were actually really good! For 1 night or 2 this hotel is perfect!"
TravEli90,"We stayed in this hotel for three nights because our luggage was still in Manila and we planned to stay only one night. The people of the hotel  were the most friendly people  I've ever met. They tried to help us in every situation. We had the chance to see three different rooms on different floors. I have to say that every room was very clean and nice, just the bathroom is not the newest anymore. The food was also really good that we decided to eat there every day. The location of the hotel is quite good. It's only three blocks to walk to the Osmena Circle."
CharmedTravelExpert,We stayed here for 1 night before our flight back to Manila. This was the last leg of our Mactan-Bohol-Cebu City. I just wished we stayed in Cebu R Hotel for at least 2 nights. Staff was great. The rooms were clean. The location was within proximity to different Cebu attractions and restaurants. I will definitely book this hotel again for future family vacations!
Bruce G,I booked for three nights and upon arrival I was upgraded to the top floor suite. Good size room with one large bed and quiet airconditioning. Everything worked well although the water pressure in the shower could be better. The rate included a freshly cooked breakfast and the staff were friendly and helpful. The location allows easy access to downtown and both Ayala and SM malls. Excellent BBQ restaurant across the road and a huge 7eleven around the corner
RubyRoseRuego,"Me and my boyfriend stayed in this hotel, though it was a last minute booking upon calling them over the phone they confirmed but just when we arrive the room was not vacant it was a standard room but they gave us the deluxe instead. This hotel is highly recommendable for people who needs a cheap stay and for people who simply want to rest their feet or for couples who wants to have their honeymoon in the island of cebu.. Their location is a secluded but safe, thus means its quiet. Staff are very accommodating, for a price of 1500 we got the deluxe room 3 beds big carpeted room LCD TC breakfast and a welcome drink. They also have an elevator which I find very nice specially for like us who hates stairs. They also have a mini ref in the room which I love.... :) Great find"
may_mktgnbg,"From reservations down to check out, the service was impeccable. The hotel has a good location: a 5-8 minute walk to/from Fuente Osmena, accessible to transport, a few blocks from the Robinsons Mall and Chong Hua Hospital, beside a salon, across a very affordable grill house, mini stores where you can buy some toiletries.  Our rooms were at the 3rd floor. A refrigerator, TV, phone are provided. The usual toiletries: shampoo, soap and conditioner were provided as well. The rooms we got were spacious and decent. With hot and cold water supply.  The free breakfast is served at the lobby.  Their staff is attentive and courteous.  Recommend for those on a budget as price is affordable and place is simple and decent."
BATEAUBAY,"this is the 2nd time I have stayed at this hotel on my 6 week holiday in Cebu. while there might be cheaper hotels around the hotel is good value for money. The rooms are big and clean,the staff are great plus b/fast is included.you can walk to Summit Circle where there are plenty of fast food shops plus Robinson has a food court with lots of cheap food.all i all Cebu R is a great place to stay. I will return there on my next holiday in Cebu"
CAI92,"First time I've ever visited Cebu, was looking for a decent hotel in the city at a reasonable price. Cebu R Hotel exceeded my expectations. Great value!   Rooms are cleaned efficiently daily, comfortable bedding, plenty of light, nice hot shower and good television service. They have a good selection for breakfast and although the wifi wasn't great on my first night, it worked perfectly the rest of my stay.  Location is in a quiet street, plenty of taxis available to take you wherever you need to go. About 5 mins away from Robinson Mall in Fuente Osmena. Only 10 mins from major shopping malls such as Ayala or SM.  Mostly, I was so impressed by the staff. They were all lovely and kind. Always smiling and helpful.   I will definitely be returning soon :)"
Ruben H,We stay there for 2 nights. The staff there was extraordinary nice. They treat us well and the service was excellent. The hotel is simple. Nothing special but clean and comfortable beds. They also have hot and cold water and the included breakfast was great. The ham and cheese omelette delicious.
wanderingage,"We stayed for 2 nights and were pretty happy with the hotel. Took a yellow cab (metered) from the airport and it cost us around 300P to get to the hotel.  We booked directly through the hotel website...they ask for one night payment in advance and that was fine with us. Everything went smoothly for check-in and check-out.  For 1350P per night, we got a room with 3 beds (1 double, 2 singles), decent size bathroom, good AC, and free wifi. The place felt clean and comfortable. Good value for money. Our window faced directly onto the side of the next building so not much of a view, but we didn't mind. Wifi in our room was in and out and we had to call down a couple times to get them to fix it. The wifi in the lobby was always working so it was ok.  They stored our bags for us for a"
Becha,"We had dinner 1 night at the hotel, too tired to go out after a full day tour with the family.  All seemed ok except for my mother's butter chicken, I didn't realised she was served with mainly chicken with bones including the neck!! The meat was coated with batter so it's hard to tell after you ate that it is mainly with bones.  I was so disappointed & asked them not to include in our bill but was still charged with it. Anyway, there was no manager to deal with my complaint so the next day, the manager apologised & offer for a refund. I was told that there was a mistake, the meat was suppose to be for the staff & not for the guest!!!!"
Mai C,"we stayed in cebu r hotel december of last year. i sent a text message to their contact # to inquire, and the number i texted called me back, and i was able to reserve thru phone. also, the person i talked to was very accommodating so extra plus points for that!  upon our arrival we were served free drinks. its rare that you'd find budget hotels which make you feel at home right away thru simple gestures like this, so again, plus points on my book. check in was pretty smooth.  our room was on the 4th floor. we stayed in a suite room which was huge! there is a couch and a small dining table, which i really liked as it gave the room a ""homier"" feel. im not sure if all rooms have a mini ref, ours had one.  the bathroom has a bath rub which was quite small, but i enjoyed it anyways."
kaiMD,"I usually have this fear of viewing photos in websites of budget hotels since it usually doesn't match the actual site..in fairness, they have a very clean room (as it appears on the site's gallery), with comfy beds & spacious bathroom..& with a very accommodating staff to top it all. They answer quickly to calls & even texts. The price is just right. My 5-year old son even appreciated the hotel's cleanliness.  Moreover, the location is great - 7 eleven is just around the corner, shamrock store is just walking distance, as well as chong hua hospital & the capitol area...;)"
marcJW53,Friendly staff I've stayed here once since  the other hotel we normally stay at was full. I'll never stay in any other hotel in Cebu. I think over the past 2 years we  have stayed in them all.  CEBU R has become  our home away from home.
Stargirl721,"Service - The staff were very friendly and accommodating. They always greeted us whenever we bumped into them in the hallways or the staircase (We used the stairs all the time since we were just on the third floor). Their English was also excellent, which is a plus for foreigners.   Value - Cebu R is very inexpensive given that it's located in the middle of the city!  Sleep Quality - We slept soundly during our stay in the hotel. We could hear people in the hallway though, especially at night when people were going back to their rooms after touring the city.  Cleanliness - The place was clean. It was just that the bottom part of the shower curtain in our room was yellow and it was supposed to be white... Stains maybe?   Location - Great location! The jeepney stop was just around"
