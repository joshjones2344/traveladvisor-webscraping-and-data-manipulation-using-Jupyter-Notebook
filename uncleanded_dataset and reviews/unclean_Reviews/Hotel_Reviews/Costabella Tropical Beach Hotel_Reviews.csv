holidaycrazy,"I stayed at this hotel with a friend in connecting rooms on a last minute booking. We were very happy.  We organised a transfer via the hotel from the airport which was excellent, I highly recommend.The resort is well kept and very attractive. The ground staff were seen working really hard everyday. The grounds are immaculate with plenty of places to sit, rest, sunbathe and just soak up the atmosphere. The gift shop is useful and has friendly staff. The reception are helpful and informative. Our rooms were beautiful, I had the biggest bed I’ve ever seen. We had a stunning view too.Rooms are super roomy and have everything you need. Complimentary water and tea/ coffee too was very welcome. They are also quiet. The housekeeping staff do an excellent job.  The food was very good,"
Elvin A,"PROS: - Nice location - on the Mactan Island beach front. - Room was big and clean. Had 2 queen-sized beds and a lot of space to boot. Room was well appointed too. - Bathroom had a tub and was also very big! - TV and aircon were modern already. - Wide selection of food in their resto and fairly-priced too.  CONS: - Lighting needs to be updated. Yellow light makes the room look so dark and haunted. - Window shutters by the hallway are starting to separate already. You'd need to manually close each slat to ensure privacy when in the room. - Beach area had white sand, but it was relatively narrow. I can imagine this will become crowded during peak seasons."
Stephen in Tokyo,"Costabella Resort is a beautiful place located on a private beach. The grounds are very well maintained by the friendly staff. It's a one stop resort with everything one could want on site including a weight training gym, an excellent spa and a dive shop. There are two separate restaurants serving delicious food. They offer something for everyone. It's quite easy to sit by the pools or the beach and really relax or do other various physical activities. Finally, I had very nice conversations with several staff members. It's quality all the way.   It's not that far from the airport so if you have a car it's convenient. Without a car one needs to hire one. We didn't venture outside the resort, but don't think there's much to see or do in the local vicinity. There's nowhere to walk,"
naomi r,"1st stop in the Philippinre and was perfect, the tours we did were brilliant. The staff were very friendly also the food was very nice. Good they had buffet & al a carte options.  The room was nice too  Right beside a local beach which was so lovely to see the local lifestyle too"
Sherpa270000,"The hotel was great, The grounds clean and tidy, the staff friendly and welcoming. But our  room looked out onto a dirty wall . No balcony to sit or  to dry your swimwear.  Food was delicious and cocktails were tasty but very over priced. Especially when you add the tax and service charge. The pool was big but not enough shade and the beach was small. Overall a good experience but meals and drinks were cheaper (and better quality)  at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Cebu where we stayed the week after."
Mariel E,We stayed for overnight in this beautiful hotel. We are fascinated by the view and accommodation they provide. The rooms was very spacious and bright they got the vibes of natural that brings peace and calm to yourself.
lorettahon,Pros: 1. Get 2 pools and one private beach for the hotel. Very convenient for any watersports or activities.  2. 30 mins free for Kayak and standing paddle. 3. Staff are accommodating and helpful.  4. Room: Spacious with Spanish colonial style. Nice balcony.  5. Towel Card: Nice idea.   Cons: 1. Location: 1KM walk to the closest restaurant. There are only 2 restaurants in the hotel and food delivery is strictly forbidden in the hotel which means either have your meal in the hotel or go outside by grab. 2. It is not easy to lock the door of the hotel room. I suggest them changing the key system to an electrical key system.
Jay3449,"When I booked this resort I didn't realise how good it would be but I was impressed from the ""get go!"" The room was great, everything worked plus excellent food and staff etc (as to be expected).  However for me the surprise was that the whole resort is smoke (and vape) free with the exception of a smoking room off to one side of the bar which was very unobtrusive. The fact that the rest of the whole resort was smoke free was an absolute joy!"
FL-WorldTraveler,"The hotel has suffered a lot with pandemic and typhoon a year ago, but they have reinvested and made improvements and are on a good path. We stayed here 5 years ago and enjoyed the stay, but this stay was even better. The grounds are a delight with lots of color and artful decor. The breakfast buffet is very good. The staff is cheerful and always helpful. We will be back in the future."
Mark K,"This was our first stop off the plane, and after 1 week. The breakfast is amazing, fresh bread, great bacon, and real hot chocolate!!! The rooms are nice and the beach is peaceful. A very ""off-the-beat"" resort. 9/10."
nelleyooo,"We stayed for 1 night for our Honeymoon. Starting from our arrival experience, even though we waited for our room to be ready it was absolutely fine and we were upgraded as well. The person who helped us with our luggage showed us the room facilities and checked if everything was working. Breakfast selection was huge. They prepared honeymoon set up as well. Thank you so much for the great stay in our special occassion."
clairewalker71,"What a wonderful week we have at The Costabella Resort. The hotel grounds are stunning, my kids loved the pools and slide, snorkelling, pool tables and table tennis. It certainly kept them busy! The rooms were outstanding. Food was good (mostly small portions) staff were super friendly and helpful 24hours a day. Top marks from us!"
rebellolyn,"A good place to celebrate any event. The ballroom cates for just about any event and the managers like Malu, the general manager; Ms Marita and the booking manager; Jo Jo are all very approachable and willing to please and help your stay at this hotel be comfortable. All the staff at the restaurants, the pools, the beach just down the path and room services are all happy to make your stay the best possible. The guards at the gate,  help with transport to anywhere you'd like to go, even to the Cascino..."
saverio b,"I spend few days with my Wife in this resort, and I must say was incredible relaxing! Big room with a Super comfortable bed, big bedroom and bathroom, you can have a massage service in your room till late night! The resort is offering few Swimming pool for adults and kids, there are few restaurants and a Spanish restopub. They provide as well some extra activities like water sports and shooting."
Danimalist,"I stayed here in July 2019 for the fourth time in five years. After not making it last summer, I am pleased to say that the things that make Costabella a fantastic place for a vacation, including the tremendous service, excellent food, and beautiful grounds remain intact. It somehow manages to be a relaxing resort, a romantic getaway, and a great place for families all at the same time. The staff at the front desk, in housekeeping, at the restaurants, and on the beach are all excellently trained and exceptionally friendly and welcoming. This time, Reyla did an excellent job checking us in, while Nino kept us informed about the hotel and entertained with his stories on the new boardwalk. It was nice to see Sir Robert still running the show at the main restaurant, as he has it"
Alvin Crofts II,Excellent visit and experience. Service wonderful as was the food. Private ocean area very secure. Massage and Gym perfect and maintained. Rooms clean and well maintained. Bed super comfy no problem sleeping. Wifi accessible in room and grounds.   Customers well taken care of.
Lisa P,"Costabella is a beautiful resort, well maintained and has very personable staff. The thought out decor, that showcases the tradition and skills of the Fillipino wood craft, immediately set the tone for what was a wonderful 4 night stay for our young family of 4. The staff are always busy, friendly and informative when you are interacting with them. The service in the restaurants was impeccable, as was the food. The menu showcases local cuisine as well as international dishes. The extensive smoothie menu, introduced me to my new favorite, a frozen kalamansie drink. We hope to return in the future!"
Jorieboi,"Went here last 18th June 2019 booked it through a travel site. The location of the place was a challenge because the place is on the other side of Cebu City, if you dont have a car then commuting will be a challenge, though if you dont mind paying a taxi or grab service then there will be no prob.The place is really secluded and very exclusive so upon walking down to the lobby, to the reception area it was really nice, by the way I arrived around 8pm so yeah I appreciated the night light and the transformation of the resort on that moment. Welcome drinks was offered, it was a mango juice and it was soo good seriously! Check-in was a breeze :) then we headed out to our room,the room temp was nice, comfy bed, coffee/tea maker available, courtesy bottled water, towels and"
Belle,"I would like to thank people who help me to make my birthday on your resort a meaningful one. Ive been frustrated as our tour in Cebu didn’t work as what we plan but as last resort that we will stay, Im very grateful to those people who help me especially on amending my booking dates. I really appreciate it.  The only negative comment I can give. I’ve noticed that staffs act differently if you are local or from Philippines. They are more accommodating to foreign guest.   I hope all staffs embodied the true hospitable characteristic of Filipinos."
BrianRooney,"The property itself was quite beautiful. Service was quite good, and the food available on site was well prepared as well as quite tasty. The property is located in a rather poor neighborhood, but getting out to other areas is easy and inexpensive. Maintenance at the property is poor. We had a leaky toilet for three days and only had it solved after two visits and telling the engineer what needed to be done to solve the problem. None of the USB charging ports were operational when I arrived, but were fixed the second day after I reported it. These problems aside, my stay was very enjoyable. The private beach is a gem, the pools were refreshing and clean, the decor and landscape make for a great relaxing vibe. It was also the biggest bed I've ever seen - the ""king size"" bed in"
Jamie Newman,"We stayed here for just the 3 nights before we started touring around Palawan. The hotel staff are great. So friendly and polite. Breakfast was really good! Great selection!  The rooms are basic, but the beds are super comfy! Non smoking hotel so you have to smoke in a glass box thing. Very bizarre.   The main restaurant was our favourite and the happy hour at the bar was reasonable with great tasting cocktails!  The beach is okay. There's so much better when outside of these resorts though! I don't think I could stay here for any longer as its a little secluded, but a really nice resort non the less."
CinCin,"A few friends and myself had a great time relaxing at this hotel. The tapas bar was super cute. They have a pool table, music, TVs and lovely decor. The huge spacious bed was very comfy. Everything was clean and we had speedy service whenever needed. We ordered room service often and it didn’t take long. However, the rice or noodles dish made a friend and myself sick. Other than that, the food is tasty! The pools are nice and the lounge areas are awesome. The beach isn’t the best but it is private. I’d stay here again."
Athena C,"My husband and I just spent our Easter Holiday in Cebu and spent 4D3N in the Costabella Tropical Beach Hotel. We had a great time and would recommend this hotel to travelers who plan to enjoy your holiday in Lapu Lapu.   The services was fabulous, all staff were very helpful, they arranged our island hopping tour and suggested yummy seafood restaurants. We loved all !   One point to remind, the overall interior of the hotel may not be that new, it is a bit old. so in case you prefer some newly furnished hotel, this is not what you should look for.  However, we were ok and had a great time there !"
MrGrimsdale025,"Have stayed here before-a few years back & the quality is still good if not better than before.  Food at restaurant is good, especially the breakfast buffet that was included in  room price. We paid about 5.5k php per night, which is quite ok for this level of resort.  Minor downside as other reviews have noted.- This place is a bit 'out of the way' from other places, meaning you are a little 'captive' at the resort,- it is not viable to walk out to other resorts or restaurants/bars etc (unlike Alona beach, Bohol or Boracay)  but the resort has all you'll need anyway. - We liked the nice globe type sun loungers, pools etc.  You can always get a taxi easily & quickly from the reception though.  Good place for a family with kids for a few nights. Not sure i'd want to spend a week"
spiv005,"Read some of the reviews after booking and thought we’d be disappointed but far from it.   We were greeted with a welcome drink at checkin which was a nice touch. Checkin was quick and efficient.   Room was spacious with two double beds and everything worked well. Water warmed up very quickly unlike some five star hotels I’ve stayed in.   Rather than going for the higher priced buffet we ordered breakfast each day from the a la carte menu which was more than enough. There were plenty of staff do even though it was a busy period over Easter the service was quick and the food was ready quickly.   There are two smallish pools but they weren’t too busy which was good. And there was a small beach with plenty of sunbeds and you could choose one in the sun or the shade, plus there were"
Lourdes Carmen,"I tot costabella resort some kind of an old and not so nice resort but i was wrong, costabella is quite good one they have nice place, clean and well maintained surroundings, its a combination of a modern and antique resort.. they beautifully preserved antique furnitures, the only problem is the location of the resort is quite remote But overall the resort is 👍👍👍👍"
Aaronwoo,"We stayed here for a few nights during a tour of the Philippines.    The hotel is great - a lot of different options for rooms.  Good amenities.  The biggest draw back is that it is away from a lot of things, but it is a resort - pools, spa, etc.  there are things to do at the hotel.  They do offer a trip to the SM Mall for those that want to shop.   The staff is great - they knew us after the first time they served us and knew what we liked.  The restaurant onsite was good - we ate all three meals there at least once.  The restaurant staff was great.   There is a beach, but not a great one - lots of grass etc.    The area is undergoing some development, so I would expect this location to get better over the next few years."
AntAttack,"My partner and myself stayed at this hotel for a long weekend in March 2019. On arrival, we were warmly greeted and the check in procedure was very smooth. (However it was slightly irritating that we had to wait an hour for our room to be ready as we requested an earlier check in on our reservation 3 weeks previously)  We had a deluxe pool side room which was very spacious with a fantastic rain shower.  We had some excellent meals at La Marina and Brisa restaurants. All the restaurant staff were very hospitable with a special mention to Jonathan who was exceptionally warm and friendly and made us feel very welcome.  Breakfast was fairly good but I was surprised that the watermelon was of such poor quality as it is grown in The Philippines.  On the negative side, the staff at The"
Anna G,"We had an amazing almost 2 weeks stay in Costabella. My daughter 6 years old was very happy enjoying all the facilities: pools, slide, beach, deck, playground and especially the kiddie corner where she could play with the animators while parents can rest on the beach or have the massage from Rosie (excellent therapist) at the Spa. We enjoyed a lot"
12769,"We LOVED the place!!! The staff were really friendly and accommodating. The food was good enough. The bedroom was great, including the bathroom! The grounds were really nice too.   Having said that, we just got a little agitated with the other guests (foreign). I think we were the only local guests. Sad to say some of the guests were rude - mostly from a particular Asian country. :( That was really a downer."
