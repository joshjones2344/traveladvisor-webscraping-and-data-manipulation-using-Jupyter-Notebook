kiwiboyz12,Booked this for my niece who was enroute Cebu to Davao. She had a pleasant stay & said the place was clean & tidy. She was picked up by the shuttle from the airport on time. All meals were part of the package which was excellent. Quality of meals was good. Thanks guys for what you do in these crazy times. All the best.
MaasGolf,We spent  just one night in one of their junior suites. Huge room with a little kitchen. Wonderful small quiet pool with in water seating directly at the pool bar. Very friendly helpful staff. Outlet mall and many restaurants within a few minutes walking distance. Fantastic breakfast and a free shuttle van to the airport early in the morning. Can definitely recommend if passing through Mactan/Cebu City.
Lucy P,"We stayed here for 1 night to catch our flight early morning.  It was such good value for money and we had a free upgrade on checking in which was a lovely surprise after a long day!  The room had loads of space and was really clean.  We went to the outlet shopping next door that had Nike, Adidas etc   The restaurant had really nice food, we both had sandwiches and a bucket of beer for good value - big shout out for Argie who was so lovely.   The airport shuttle was included in the stay which you need to book when you check in, it was so easy and quick!"
Jude Palces,"I had a wonderful 2 days at Eloisa's. The property is 15-20 minutes from the airport.There is an outlet nearby for shopping and dining. Everything started right with a free shuttle from the airport. Check-in was seamless and easy. What really set this property apart from other hotels, in my opinion, was the friendly and caring staff. I had a Junior Suite and it was huge. The sheets smelled fresh. Bathroom was clean and had all the amenities one expects from a hotel. Free breakfast was excellent with a lot of choices. The live band in Daku Bistro really added a nice touch to total experience. I did not try the pool but it is aesthetically designed and looks really pretty at night. I will definitely return to this place the next time I am in town."
Aillen L,"At first glance, we thought that it’s just a simple hotel, but when we checked-in.. it was totally beyond expectation. + Room- stylish and spacious with excellent Wi-Fi. Bathroom is small but it’s fine. Breakfast-i love the buffet and the staff were nice. Place- I’m soo in love with the place and it’s like you’re in a resort. Pool- Nah! Soo beautiful and with stylish curtains. It’s even more nice at night. Good for kiddos. - Location- It’s away from the downtown, but it’s not fine since there are malls with fantastic restaurants and boutiques beside the hotel."
42Veggies,"Would be a five star review had they not put us in room 203, facing the main road. The honking all night did not help our jetlagged bodies to fall asleep.  Also the second night the people in room 204 arrived at 4 am heavily intoxicated, they were screaming in the hall ways and after half an hour took their noise into their room, the one next to ours, and continued loudly screaming and laughing until I got out of bed, got dressed, went into the hallway and yelled at them to shut up. Really we were right above the reception and the staff should have adressed this situation within minutes.  But back to the rave review because the hotel really is very good. The beds are very comfortable, the room is immaculately clean and very nice and well equiped, the staff go out of their way to"
Meggy,"We stayed at Eloisa Royal Suite for a night since it was near the airport and we have an early flight the next day. We arranged our transfer-in with them and they were very flexible. Our flight was delayed (we arrived at 10 pm) and when we called, they said they have a flight tracker so we need not worry. Check-in was a breeze and we were upgraded to an executive room. Our room is nice, it has access to the pool🙂. I guess whether the room has a window or not will depend on the type of room you booked. They have a takeaway breakfast for those who have an early flight. You may choose between bacon with rice or tuna sandwich. My only comment is that wifi is a bit slow in our room. Overall we had a wonderful night and will stay here again if we go back to Mactan Cebu."
LJ V,The hotel looks nice but the room is smaller than I thought. The staffs are really helpful. Food is good could be better. They have free shuttle so it's good to consider it airport hotel it's not that far but always leave early Cebu always have chaos traffic.
94klj,"Great hotel in a great location. Ideal for people looking to stay near the airport, although not much in the surrounding area. The room was very clean and a decent size. The reception staff were extremely helpful when we were checking in and at all other times. We had two early morning trips and had breakfast prepared for us on departure. Was great for a two night stay over between destinations."
RaynerAO,"My 2nd stay here and I wasn’t disappointed at all. My stay at Eloisa was very pleasant. Location wise, it was great for me. Food area probably 5 mins walk away? Outlet shops too for those who want to shop. Close to airport too.  The staff were really helpful and approachable. My room (located in the same building as the lobby) was clean, comfortable (toilet too) and everything functioned well.  For those who want to keep fit, their gym, though small, was clean and well equipped with proper machines and weights.  The best experience though was when I was done with work for the day (late afternoon), had already checked out in the morning but was sticky and sweaty. I wanted to book a room for a couple of hours just to freshen up but was instead lead by the staff to their guest"
Littlelizamay,"The staff are friendly and helpful. The room was clean with a fridge, kettle, and tv. as well as hairdryer. It is near the airport and the hotel has its own transport which is very useful. It would have been great if there was some form of ""welcome pack"" in the room detailing the services available in the hotel as well as a list of attractions nearby."
Max W,"My girlfriend and I booked this hotel quite late during the day due to our flight rescheduling. We decided to choose this hotel due to the close proximity to the Mactan Airport on the map. We did request pick-up from the airport in our online booking, however as it was late during the day, the hotel may not have seen it.  When we landed at almost midnight, not to our surprise, we were unable to find any hotel personnel for the pick-up service. We called the hotel and they said that the driver was already at the airport, however they were not able to tell us where exactly the driver was waiting. It was made more confusing as the airport has a number of exits. We called the hotel a number of times and explained our exact location where we would be waiting, and after an hour or so"
Zhaun O,"When checking in, please ask for a room on the new wing where rooms are smaller but are more thought-out and have a view of the pool and are away from the road (read: less traffic noise)  Here is the lowdown:  1. Free airport transfer 2. Buffet breakfast 3. Luscious sheets, down (duck feather) pillows. They gave me dour pillows on my Queen-sized bed 4. Awesome customer service! Everyone greets you with a smile 5. Walk from the lobby to room is about 50-meters but they insist to drive u via gold cart 6. I asked how much their bottled water is (was thirsty), they insisted on giving it to me for free on top of the 2 bottles that was already in my room 7. You can get a poolside room for as low as 3500 8. They'll be offering speedboat island tours soon! 9. It's near Plantation Bay"
Danny,"This hotel was incredible. Seemed like it was newly renovated and they were looking for a super modern look. It was good. I could tell that they were kind of limited on space, but they still did great with the space they had. I actually received a message through Orbitz, from the staff, asking when I would arrive and if I needed pickup from airport/wherever. That was very nice. Check in was smooth and painless. The room was very nice, bed very soft, bathroom was very nice, but the room was a bit small. Which was fine because that's the room I selected, but it was still very nice. Checked in, showered, then walked about 5 minutes to this strip mall/restaurant area nearby, where there are many many food/shop options. Right next door to the hotel is a massage place, reasonable"
Ian C,"During my second stay here, the staff never failed to give me a very relaxing stay. Their tireless but genuine greetings, quality service and more vibrant hotel will make you decide to stay here again and again.  The wedding that i would be attending is pretty far from here but knowing how Eloisa crews take care of their guests, I don't mind traveling farther coz I can't sacrifice that relaxing stay I wanna achieve this time.   Thank you ERS! Keep up the good work! 😊"
Divina A,"Just the best of the best, our second stay in this hotel, rooms are clean, big, comfy beds and modern, they have free shuttle from the airport, breakfast is amazing, everybody that works at the hotel are just super nice. Thank you again for the great stay, we will see you guys soon.  Salamat"
Beth I,"We flew into Cebu airport late and they provided a very nice van shuttle for free. The rooms are nice and clean. Very modern. The bed was so comfortable I forgot we were in Asia! The staff are helpful and friendly. We recommend this place to anyone. Only negative thing was the traffic noise starting about 6am but it wasn't terrible, you could just hear it. We will stay here again!"
Littledeans,"Best hotel in Lapu-Lapu city, they provide free airport transfer. Massage center just right next door of the hotel and easy access. Area surrounded by the Nike factory outlet there are Puma, Giodano, Levis, Adidas, timbeland and so on. There are Robinson market store for your convenience, and also 7 eleven, Love this hotel will all the friendly staff especially the bell boy,security and receptionist. They provide hairdryer the most important things that i would like to put a comment. Due to the hot weather and caused that taking shower few times a day hair dryer are seriously needed by me (May be for other tourist as well)"
jneth5,"Love this place! I booked Eloisa so we have a place to stay during our long lay overs in Mactan, Cebu (from and to USA). I love that they have a free airport shuttle service. It gave me so much peace of mind that we are being taken care of especially that we were transiting in the odd hours of the night. Many thanks to Oscar Luna of the concierge. I commend him for his hard work and care for my family. He is very polite and extended valuable tips and information. Thank you, Oscar!   Eloisa also offer a shuttle service with minimal fee if you desire to go places or arranged for pick up.   A massage parlor is located next door, which comes handy to work the kinks out of your body after the long flights.   Food is no problem. They have a restaurant on the first floor.   The hotel"
Len D,"Accommodating  and friendly  staff, neat and clean room. We stayed 2 days in a suite room and 2 days in a deep Luxe room. The weekend dinner buffet  was absolutely  great. I love their pasta and pancit that the chef will cook live according  to your liking."
BDCE,"This is a great hotel for budget conscious travelers or business travelers who just need a place to sleep after a hectic day.  This is a relatively new hotel. Value for money hotel.  LOCATION:  About 10 to 15 minutes from the Airport. Walking distance to Robinson's grocery, factory outlets of such brands as Adidas, Oakley, Giordano, Converse, etc, and dining establishments.  A ride away from the Island mall.  Along the main road and accessible to public transportation. Free airport transfers.  ROOM: We booked the room with 3 single beds.  Room was big but with no windows. furnishing is quite modern.  Room and bathroom were clean.  Bathroom has a shower with hot water.  FOOD:  The only restaurant in the hotel is quite small but serves good food.  Grilled tuna belly is highly"
ziggy2l,"When we checked in from Mactan Airport, we made the mistake of not using the free shuttle service from the hotel. The cab fare was not that bad anyways, just hard for some taxi driver to find the place because it is new. The hotel itself is nice and new, for the promo price; it's worth it. Staff was helpful specially the security guards. There was this one waiter that was hard to communicate with but it was a minor thing. The bathroom sometimes smelled funky and our room was hard to find, it was like a maze. But let me emphasize that all of these were minor."
Vinay-OnTheGo,"Stayed for a Day in the hotel with my chinese friends. Very nice and friendly hotel staff. Clean Hotel, Nice service, 15 minutes drive from the Cebu Airport. Had to check-out early morning at 5 but the hotel arranged a free shuttle although it was raining and packed our breakfast too.  Very nice and comfortable stay!"
jodyk505,"Stayed one night on Tuesday, September 16th before catching a flight from Cebu to Puerto Princesa the next day.  Was greeted by the receptionist and she handled check in tasks superbly explaining everything comprehensively.  The rooms were spotless and the hotel was very quiet.  The breakfast buffet is awesome and if you feel like pampering yourself, head over to the spa and massage parlor right next door.  Very close to Mactan Cebu and Robinson Supermarket and factory store outlet."
ALLAN S,"Stayed 2 nights for business in the area. *10 mins drive from the airport. *Short walk to Outlet Store, Robinsons Supermart, 7-11, Mcdonalds, restos. *hotel looks and feels new. *airport shuttle available. *buffet breakfast...good selection. *wifi, cable tv, a/c. *beds and pillows are memory foam...slept very well. *toilet and bath...very good."
djali9,"This is a great place to stay. The staff are friendly and the service is excellent. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Not every room has a window, so keep that in mind when booking. We booked as a large adult family group, and emailed prior to arrival; the staff were excellent, sorting out our complicated booking and accommodating all our requests. My baggage was delayed at the airport, but the staff were very helpful and called to sort out delivery of my suitcase for me. The hotel is in a good location for looking around both the cities of Lapu Lapu and Cebu.  I would definitely stay here again!"
JenTravelMeHappy,"This hotel was one of the best we had so far on the Philippines. The room was really nice, the shower was great, the bed comfortable, the WIFI worked in our room, the staff was very friendly and especially the onion soup from the inhouse restaurant was very delicious. Also the shuttle to the airport was free."
Kit Yeung,"I spend almost three night in Eloisa because of there staff and teams is really the best, they all friendly and hard work, whatever u ask they will do it and try to be very helpful, they are the great team to serve the customer well. i have been travelling many countries and city and i bn visited different hotel but i find Eloisa is just like your home in cebu, u just missed them even i leave cebu and i return back again to check in Eloisa when i need hotel in cebu, i am also a budget traveller but i find it worth to pay more for they service because the bed is the most comfortable in cenu, and clean, the room is not to big as photo, this is one of the issue i talk to them, but except that the breakfast is a bit not western so i request for a western toast and sausage breakfast"
Sweetcath,"Well,no more I can say to this hotel. From the driver, guard to all the staff of this hotel. I and my husband are very proud and happy while we stay to this hotel. We felt like we are home becausw of the staff. Very energetic, always smile😁☺😀😊. Not like the other hotel we stay to mention(the bellavista hotel).,I really don't like the staff there. And by the way we had our free breakfast for 3 nights and the foods are very delicious,and also we try to eat their foods for lunch which is `TUNA BAGAYBAY,STEAMED TUNA STICK and GINGER SOUP "" All their foods are very delicious. Also the place is near the Outlets for shoes products.You can walk for 2-3 mins. And easy to get taxi wherever you go.because its near in terminal. I hopw to stay again in this hotel for next vacation. I and"
Eonlight,"Clean and modern room with free wifi, free shuttle and buffet breakfast, in fact they made us a special omelet that morning which we really appreciate of their kindness. All staffs are great and very hospitable.   The restaurant, lift and check in/out counter is all in one compact space. In fairness management did their best in maximising the space for the functions, a credit to them. Also it would be good if windows are double glaze for noise reduction from traffic all night.  A much decent place to stay in Mactan and Cebu in comparison to other accommodations around and a good base if you like to go to the beach around Mactan Island. Highly recommended to travellers. Value for money."
Kim C,"This hotel Lacks a pool and a beach, however, that is fine because you can travel to another resort to use theirs.  The thai massage business located next door provides excellent services and very affordable prices.  The food and the service at this hotel was quick and sufficient. My breakfast was included and it was good. The prices for buffet dinner was affordable and good at p399/person. The room I booked was a deluxe and was so tiny for two people. However, it was very clean and new and I only needed it for two nights.  The location is in a busier area next to the outlet stores and other stores, walking distance. Short ride to the malls and to the city. It's a bit sketchy at night of outside the hotel."
Desidel,"This is a very nice place to stay, I stayed here July 2015. Perfect location for shops, airport and trips to Lapu Lapu Cebu City also. Very friendly staff, couldn't do enough to help you, the rooms were very good to, nice and clean. Food here was good, Wi Fi ok, airport transfer included . I will definitely stay here again, everything here was good, I couldn't find any faults. This is a good place to stay. Thanks to all the friendly staff."
Graeme M,"Very comfortable hotel , Biggest bed ever with the most pillows,comfort plus, Large room with microwave , Grill oven , full size under bench fridge , Always given clean towel and  a room clean every day.   The breakfast was sumptuous with a nice range , The best of all was the lovely helpful pleasant staff making our stay the best ever . Thank you all so much."
erezmazor,if you're en-route this place is really close to the Cebu airport. Clean and nice and the staff is really sweet. The rooms have no window but the AC is working great so it's not stuffy. All in all this is a great spot to spend a night or two.
Samuel D,"I had a fantastic stay in Eloisa. The rooms were very comfortable, clean and great value for money. The staff were all very accommodating and attentive to my every need. The hotel pick-up and drop off were a bonus with friendly and careful drivers. The breakfast was sumptuous and wifi was great. i will surely come back again soon."
appmountaingirl,"About 10-15 minutes from the airport, Eloisa is a great pick for early-morning flights.  The hotel is still quite new, and the rooms (though very small) were comfortable and pristine.  After 2 weeks in 4 other hotels in Asia, this was the most comfortable bed out of all of them!  Staff were exceptionally helpful, offering to pack us a breakfast (at no charge) for our 3:45 AM departure.  Shuttle to the airport was scheduled at a time that suited us, not stuck to an on-the-hour schedule.   About 25 minutes from Cebu City shopping, about 15 minutes from Lapu-Lapu beach areas, and about 15 minutes from the airport.    Highly recommended!"
DonPedros,"Having been appointed a night at the Eloisa by the airline due to a cancelled flight, the choice to stay here was not one in which I was involved by other means than accepting the offer by the airline. Being located very close to Mactan Intl. Airport in Cebu, it's great for people with airport activities. The rooms are small, but they are modern, clean and well equipped. Our room on the top floor had issues such as non-functioning sockets, leaking showers, non-functional phones, sporadically non-functional elevator and other minor issues, however I should empathise they were minor issues. The food from the cafe in the hotel was decent, however it was with great disappointment that I found that their Tuna was not real Tune, but ""White Tuna"", or rather the variant which actually"
Eddie AMS,"Learned about this hotel via Tripadvisor and booked it based on good reviews.  Service is really good in this hotel. All staff are friendly and very helpful. The room rate is reasonable and location is good if you prefer to stay in Mactan Island and closer to the airport. There is a factory outlet with some dining options within easy walking distance.   I booked a superior room. The room is nice and clean. The only downside was that there is no window and wifi coverage is very very minimal to zero. But, for the price that you pay, it compensated the aforesaid and we could always go to the lobby for better internet coverage.   To add, this hotel provides free airport transfers. You just need to inform them your flight details once you've made your bookings, regardless of booking"
