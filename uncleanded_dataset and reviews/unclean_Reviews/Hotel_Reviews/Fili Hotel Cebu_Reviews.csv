Charlemagne Ambrad,"As of the writing of this review, we are still at the lobby waiting for our rooms to be ready.  We are checking into NuStar Fil hotel right after we checked out from Sheraton Mactan resort for 3 days and 3 nights. The difference between Sheraton and NuStar is like day and night when it comes to service.   We arrived in NuStar via LG parking lot. We arrived we multiple large luggage‚Äôs and although there are multiple hotel personnel standing by the x-ray machine no one dares to help us unload our stuff. After they x-rayed our bags no one guided us where to go and they just stand there and busy themselves chitchatting. We carried all our bags to the elevator.  At the check-in reception: it was very disorganized and it looks like that most personnel don‚Äôt even know what to do. While"
Iza p,"Everything is just perfect! Staff- extremely Polite and accommodating, your comfort is their Top Priority. Room- very big, even bigger (wink) is the bathroom. I like the beds and the interior of the room. Tastefully designed. Breakfast buffet- OMG this is especially wonderful. Their Menu is extensive and everything is just delicious."
Sanitv,"I stayed here for 4 nights during recent trip to Cebu. The hotel is located in the complex with restaurants and casino. However, the mall section still under construction.  Check In and check out progress is slow but helpful staff. The room is wide and fully equipped, espacially very comfortable mattress. The breakfast was also good with varieties of western and local food."
Angelica T,"Manager Johanne Espinosa, Head Concierge Stephen Santiago and Vince of the concierge team went above and beyond to assist guests. Even though the hotel was quite new, they responded to every request timely and attentively with a smile. Exceeded expectations for sure!"
Christopher P,"As part of the organizing council of ABAC in Cebu. I was amazed as we arrived at Fili Hotel. The hotel is modern, clean,stylish and very luxurious from lobby to convention and rooms, it was extremely elegant and spacious.The food was great too. The hotel employees were very friendly. Although, I would say that there is room for improvement in terms of service. In particular, as we were preparing  in the Convention Hall B for the plenary meeting. I requested one male wait staff for chairs to be placed in the control booth, I waited for the chairs for about 20 minutes but the guy did not come back, so I went out to the lobby and was waiting for him impatiently as we needed the chairs but I could not find him, until one female wait staff named Lyn approached me and asked if she"
Oleg Mikhailov,"I visited Cebu for the ABAC and stayed here. Excellent Service from the hotel staff, upon arrival I was given a welcoming drink by a tall pretty lady named Lyn, what caught my attention is her warm and welcoming smile. The orange fizz was refreshing by the way. The room was very spacious, clean and had the amenities needed. Breakfast was delicious and with many choices. The people in the reception were very helpful in checkin and check out. Transaction was smooth. The convention were we held the meetings was very clean and staffs were very quick to replenish water, pencils and paper. Coffee and tea was good and Lyn was there too always smiling and helpful in giving directions to spots. She also recommended Fina restaurant and food was great. The location is great and near"
NewYorkWorldExplorer,"The hotel is part of the Nustar resort in the South Reclamation area which is a few minutes away from all the tourist spots and Cebu‚Äôs business district. The rooms are sparkling new and have beautiful views of the Mactan Bridge, the water, downtown, and the hills which all light up nicely at night. The bathrooms are luxurious and all amenities are provided. The most enjoyable part of our stay was the breakfast buffet at the Fili Cafe. Food was delicious and service was top notch. At the time of our visit, the mall, the sauna and spa, and certain areas of Nustar resort were still under construction or not yet operational. I expect it to be a popular destination when the entire Nustar resort is fully operational in 2024. Thumbs up!"
Stephanie C,"I am curious about the newest & famous 5 star hotel in Cebu City! As a family, we decided to dine in FILI cafe. The name itself is classy and inviting as well. So we decided to try just this month of Julu & I was surprised by the authenticity of the food! It was soooo delish and worth every penny! PLUS, the staff named DAN who accommodated is was very witty and his services to us was outstanding! He made us feel comfortable always and he was mindful everytime we need some assistance. Dan is highly commendable if only I have more time to commend him at that moment. He is one of the best servers I have ever met! Will definitely dine again at Fili and looking forward for Dan to assist us. Kudos to the entire staff for the great service. üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª"
Travel@buckets,"Good modern business hotel  New facilities  Booked a sea view room  Check in was uneventful  Staff are very attentive  Some facilities are still not open at the time  Pool side has great views but there‚Äôs no bar service -(  Room ample space for 2 adults  Beds pillows are very comfortable  Breakfast was great - multiple Asian and western selections  Tried Fili restaurant which is within the premises and the food is not only good but reasonably priced  Overall stay was satisfactory , close enough to explore the City so I would stay here again."
Lynne Smith,"This is one of the newest hotels in Cebu City, so our family opted to visit this place. The property is still under construction especially the Nustar hotel.  This place was great and you have plenty of great restaurants from Michelin star to great Steakhouse you can choose from. Also, the staff were all nice and accommodating, special mention to Jane from the front desk and to the housekeeping team who maintains our room clean and tidy. One thing I noticed though is that we kept hearing noises outside our room at some point during our stay so I figured it was not really a sound proof one. The breakfast buffet was mouthwatering even though the varieties were kinda limited. Overall it was a great stay and definitely coming back."
Tim W,"Coffee and frappes were great, blueberry muffin was soft and not too sweet. The ambiance is very luxurious and comfortable. Prices not too high despite the location and 5-star hotel location. Elvie was very accommodating and helpful."
Xheelah M,Very accommodating crew. The food is really authentic and delicious. They also have a surprise sing and dance presentation for the birthday celebrant. The ambiance is good and they also have a very cold air-conditioning.

Ladylyn L,"We dont like the beef kare kare and the oven baked tahong. The price doesnt justify the taste. Takes too long to serve the foods.   Shoutout to our very good servers, kim & robert. They made it  bearable with their services."

Sakurayku,"I had a great experience staying at Fili, the staff were very hospitable. I would like to say a good job for the housekeeping team for their work, keep it up! My room was very clean and tidy which I appreciate, I would like to thank Kurt, Rose and Franz for that. The Fili Cafe had nice employees and would accommodate to our needs and the food was great! The sea view was amazing when swimming."
