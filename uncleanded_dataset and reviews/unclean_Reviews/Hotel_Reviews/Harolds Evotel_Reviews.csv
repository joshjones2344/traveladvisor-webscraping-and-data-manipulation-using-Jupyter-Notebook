ms c,"There should be facial tissue in the room, because tissue was only in the bathroom.                   For Breakfast, It was tasty but I wish there are more fruits. Thanks to Plisken, Nicole, Vilma, Joseph, and Erika for the services during the breakfast. Chito in the breakfast area really provided a good service.   Air conditioner was really good, so cool. Overall, Service is really kind and hospitable."

lhn4901,Room is comfortable and breakfast was very good with plenty of choices.  Latte s are extra but excellent.  Bathroom towels seemed worn out  but the shower was great. Electricity goes off when you leave the room but i understand it‚Äôs super expensive in PH. The walk to Ayala Mall is not far but crossing the street is dicey.     Overall good value. Ask for Angela‚Ä¶very kind staff overall!!
Maria Risa R,"I am actually a regular and my former boss was a regular too‚Ä¶.the Late Senator turned Mayor John Henry R. Osme√±a‚Ä¶.This is what you call a home away from home. The warmth of the people that surrounds the hotel from the management to the staff is really amazing‚Ä¶ There are no requests that were left unheard and I would commend the team of the very beautiful Miss Tracy together with Rina, Jake and Toni‚Ä¶you guys are truly wonderful. I will highly recommend this hotel if you want to relax  and rest from your busy routine.."
