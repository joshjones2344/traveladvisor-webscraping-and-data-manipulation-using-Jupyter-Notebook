Cy M,The first thing that I noticed when I came to Seda is how clean and how fragrant the hotel lobbies and the front desk area. They’ve got welcoming staffs which is important. I enjoyed my stay here and would definitely come back.
YJ KIM,"직원분들 친절하시고 위치가 정말 최고입니다. 세부 it city내에서 어디든 가깝게 갈수 있어요. 아이들 여름 방학때 3주 머물렀습니다. 여기있는동안 리셉션의 Mr.Nathan이 친절하게 우리를 돌봐주었습니다. 지내는 동안 우리가 필요한 사항을 친철하게 안내해주었습니다. 그리고 조식 식당에 ms. Razel은 언제나 반갑게 우리를 맞이해주었습니다. 두 분 덕분에 즐겁게 하루를 시작할 수 있었습니다. Mr.Nathan과  Ms.Razel에게 다시한번 감사인사를 전하고 싶습니다. The staff are friendly and the location is really great. You can go anywhere close to Cebu it city. Stayed for 3 weeks during my children's summer vacation. While we were here, Mr.Nathan at the reception kindly took care of us. During our stay, he kindly guided us through what we needed. And in the breakfast room Ms. Razel was always happy to welcome us. Thanks to the two of them, our family were able to start the day happily. We would like to thank Mr.Nathan and Ms.Razel agan."
Rod,Marygrace Macasling deserve a raise. She’s very accommodating with outstanding customer service all throughout our stay in Seda Hotel.She always get in touch with us to make sure that we are comfortable and satsified with the service. She’s an asset to your company. Kudos!
Culture53915383979,"All the hotel staff was very accommodating at breakfast. They immediately understood that my son overslept and could not make it to the lobby for breakfast each morning, and I greatly appreciated the fact that they brought my son's breakfast to our room. I especially would like to thank ms. Alexis and ms. Angel for their kindness. (sorry if I spelled it wrong).  I would like to stay again next time.  Thank you so much. Our family made the special memory in 2023 summer."
Queensbie H,I love the staff and their services. They really are kind-hearted and accommodating. They really do work best for their people. I appreciate all of them and grateful for their selfless service. Kudos!
Bing,"We went there to celebrate Mom's birthday, and surely we had a blast. The employees, notably Sir Nathan at the front desk and Miss Wengi at Straight Up Bar, are incredibly friendly and helpful. I adore how everyone in Seda would greet us with warm smile. Booked two rooms and I must say each room is very clean but the lighting in Room 1614 was kind of dim, hopefully they will install more lights in this room soon. The pool was also very nice and the staff would really ensure the guests' safety and comfort. Without a doubt, I'll return soon!"
Jonathan L,"We stayed here for a few days with family while visiting from America. We had such a great stay that we went back a couple weeks later when my husband and son joined us. The hotel is very clean and modern. We stayed in the 3 bedroom family suite, which felt like a fully furnished apartment. The best part was the staff, particularly Kingswell, Razel and Rose from Miso restaurant, Loren and Kyla from front desk, and McCoy from housekeeping. Everyone was nice though! The location in IT Park is perfect. We look forward to our next visit!"
Mark Benedict,"Seda is a really good hotel that is contemporary and equipped with all the amenities required, so we were quite happy with our stay there with my friends. It is conveniently located near the bus stops, making it an excellent starting point for exploring Cebu's city attractions. The staffs are excellent, particularly Sir Nathan who were extremely friendly and helpful in recommending some place to enjoy here in Cebu. I would also like to commend Sir Clifford and Ms Wengie from the bar, definitely the best people we met while staying here, you guys have the best staffs. Thank you!!"
Wenfes Joy L,"The place is so nice and the people are so welcoming, diffinetly will go back once I visit again. The food is good the front desk are very nice people too and everything in the hotel is just great for travellers ."
Maybe09180,"My family and I with my Mama stayed here for 2 days upon arrival to Cebu and 3 days before leaving Cebu and those days have been nothing but AMAZING. All thanks to Ms. Loren Dignos and her outstanding team. She made sure that my mom's room and our room are right next to each other so Lola can spend more time with the kids. The Filipino breakfast option was nothing but delightful and enjoyed the most by everyone especially my kids. My daughter loved the rice and dried fish and my son loved the puto and sikwate. It was such a treat for them after not having it for almost 4years. The pool was the other highlight that my kids enjoyed the most. Pool was well maintained, and fresh towels were readily available.  The beds and pillows were quite comfortable that despite the jetlag we"
Curious22221457110,"とても従業員の方々が優しかったです！また、朝ごはんがとても美味しかった！ Sedaにはプールとジムもあり、とても便利で、楽しいです またここに来たいです  The employees were very kind! Also, the breakfast was very good! Seda has a pool and gym, very convenient and fun! I would love to come back here again.  Thank you!"
Sleepy A,Breakfast is my favorite part. Their complimentary toiletries such good for your skin and hair. The view in our room is very scenic. Their staffs are very accommodating and professional. The hotel is connected to the mall so its very convenient.
Marie Laudine T,"My friends and I have not seen each other in a long time and we decided to catch up at Seda. It was very classy yet it felt as if you're still at the comfort of your own home. The server, Mr. Kingswell was very friendly and professional. He accommodated us very well."
Karen C,"I booked a studio room and the first thing I noticed was the musty smell. I called the front desk and they said they will get me an air purifier- never happened. I got so sick the next day, my room was not cleaned, no air purifier- j could not get out of bed. My symptoms improved when I left- it was the worst stay ever . Room 1402- you guys should clean the air filter- it was a horrible experience and I complained, no one came forward to follow up or check on me. I was in disbelief. It was an absolute nightmare!"
Umay Ş,"Rooms are very clean and when you need anything they will provide it 24/7. Everyone speaks English and is eager to make your stay more comfortable. It was my first time in the Philippines and I loved it, would stay here again."
Melissa R,We stayed here multiple times during our 2.5 weeks trip and the service was extraordinary. Throughout our trip we also would stay at a few different resorts and Seda’s service was incomparable. Kingswell was a great waiter especially during breakfast.
Elizabeth V,"Last month, my family and I had the opportunity to spend our weekend at the Seda Hotel Ayala Central Bloc IT Park Lahug Cebu City. The hotel is right beside Ayala Mall . The hotel was the perfect setting for a relaxing getaway. The surroundings were stunning, and we enjoyed our time at the hotel.  Swimming pool, Gym and bar at the roof top.  From the moment we entered the hotel lobby, we were impressed. The interior decor was luxurious yet warm and inviting. The One Bedroom Residence room that we booked was spacious and clean with comfortable  bed and linen. There is a kettle, fridge, iron, washer and dryer and a 2 large TV which we loved. The bathroom was nice with hair blower and bathroom scale.   On the whole, we enjoyed the hospitality at Seda Hotel and we had a wonderful"
Mackenzie Y,"Great breakfast and service, Kingswell is the best server! We had breakfast almost every day, and it was always hot with lots of variety and choices for everyone. Rooms were clean and the pool was great!"
Tony Y,"Wonderful experience. Great, friendly and helpful staff. Delicious breakfasts and awesome service. Maid service was great too, very clean. Even though it’s in the heart of the city, this hotel was still fairly quiet and muted out the traffic noise. The pool was lovely, workout place was sizable and had great equipment. We had a very nice stay. THANK YOU, Seda Central Bloc!"
Tourist15383602652,"Super Excellent food, place/environment and good services. There is nothing more I can say. I love the moments we shared while we’re taking our breakfast here in Seda hotel. I am very satisfied ❤️❤️❤️"
michaelciel,"Currently 2 weeks into a 5 week stay and as on our previous visit we are thoroughly impressed.  The two bedroom fully serviced apartment is modern and well appointed. Comfy bed and living areas along with two large bathrooms and laundry.  Centrally located in IT Park with supermarket, shopping mall and endless restaurants, cafes and fast food outlets on your doorstep.  Hotel Restaurants are very good and reasonably priced. Food is delicious, very well prepared with endless variety. Outside dining offered on the rooftop along with pool and gym.  The service is second to none in Cebu and is world class. After all a hotel no matter how well presented is nothing without warm, welcoming , friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Also when you are on a long stay in a hotel it is a big test"
alwaystravelsf,"Not a High End Luxury hotel but almost there!  The positive is it’s very clean, quality of finishes very polished and staff excellent and friendly!  Also the location is great as it’s connected to the Ayala Central Block mall.  Lots of restaurants/bars nearby and also Sugbo Mercado.  Room was great and had the 1 bdr apartment which very affordable.   On the negative side is the on-site restaurant breakfast buffet is not good imo.  Many items had run out and not replaced, food isn’t cooked very well and mostly cold.  Many guests will open the holding container and leave open.  Also egg station specialty is eggs sunny side up but they’re always cold even after they just make them.    Swimming pool adequate but kinda small it’s on roof.  So understandable, gym very small, can hear"
jayford l,We stayed at Seda IT Park for vacation and I really had fun during our stay. Everything is accessible from malls to food park. Staffs are great and warmth welcoming especially Nathan who assisted us from check-in and check-out. He gave us a very nice IT Park view and a complimentary drink at the bar. Thank you Nathan and to all the friendly staff! We'll surely be back this year for my grandma's birthday.
Adventure47542725541,"Great people and very friendly.  At the bar I met Emil and he doing very good Job and also at the Miso buffet resto, I met Kingswel he entertain really well , friendly and hard working. Over all , all staff is doing great. Also i can see ,The lady manager , she was doing very good job for helping her staff at the Miso Resto."
Bby L,"the nightly fare is well rewarded with a fantastic experience. this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in anywhere. Everything except the pool deck are wonderful. Unfortunately the tiles used at the pool washroom entrance are very slippery. Why hasn't the hotel removed and replaced them? I slipped, and the guard said, we have already told management about the inappropriate tiles. so, you know about this. Change the tiles. It is not a big job."
Clair D,"Everything is great and very accessible to malls and park. Me and my colleagues would surely choose it again next time we visit Seda. Thanks to Nathan, for your accommodating and helping us through your services."
Michiko N,"Stayed with my auntie for two nights in a two bedroom, and our stay was great! the service was awesome! Our room was supposed to come with a washer and dryer but only came with a dryer, so they offered us complimentary laundry service. One of the servers was exceptional and incredible with his service (thanks Kingswell!) and he made our breakfast time super enjoyable! Great food too!! Loved everything about our stay!"
Curious17005830904,"Superb inn. Excellent service the room was big, clean, and had everything we needed. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious; The buffet had a very large selection. I had the opportunity to speak with the telephone operators at night because I was having a bad day. They were extremely accommodating and friendly, and I would like to commend them for their excellent service. I believe their names are Diana, Kyla, and Kiara. The location is excellent! right adjacent to the shopping center and I would recommend this hotel to my friends.  Seda, thank you!"
Godxxx01,"This place is great.  The people are really helpful BUT i find it a bit strange to put 2 trainees just standing the whole day by the entrance to greet the hotel guests.  I find it a bit inhumane. I think their talent be use better by really training them. We got an upgrade with a stunning view of city. Not just a room but a BIG 1-bedroom APARTMENT with a functioning washing machine and separate dryer.   The pool was great on the rooftop but the bar is being built, that was a bummer.  I checked our the roof top bar in the evening.  Nice view and vibes and good offers to choice.  Unfortately, it closed really early at  midnight. Highly recommended in the middle of the new spot in Cebu city, the IT PARK with great going out scene and never sleeps due to the overwhelming presence of"
John Alexander Q,"The building feels very brand new. I got a one-bedroom and it was well laid out. The view from the room was also nice. My room had a kitchenette, dining table, couch, and lots of space.   If you are renting a car with driver or have your own car, the parking area exit is next to the drop-off point, so there is really not much wait for your pick-up.  Breakfast was a let down, it was purely Filipino and nothing great. This needs real menu improvement.  Overall I had a great stay."
