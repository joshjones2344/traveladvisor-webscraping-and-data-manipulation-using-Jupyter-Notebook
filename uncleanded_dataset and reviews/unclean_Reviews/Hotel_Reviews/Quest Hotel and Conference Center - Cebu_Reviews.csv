BondGirl54,"Our 3rd stay in Quest Hotel, Cebu. We find this hotel as very reasonably priced and the service is excellent. We always book with breakfast included in the daily rate. The Buffet Breakfast is voted Best in Cebu. There‚Äôs excellent spread and food selection in the Pus√¥ Restaurant. We are always spoiled by the staff i.e. Eric, John, Job, Mark, Juicy and Rana. Shout out to Eric and John for always preparing our coffee and pot of black tea and to Juicy for our over easy and sunny side up eggs and the bowl of noodle soup. The fresh fruits (mango, banana and water melon) are sweet and delicious. The native puto maya plus hot sikwati (100% chocolate) are also our favorites. These staff are very attentive and they are always happy to serve you up the best of their ability. As such, I"

Karla B,"Quest has been our always go-to hotel whenever our company is organizing a business trip. I had stayed at the hotel for numerous times already, even during pandemic and their quality has been maintained since then. Starting from airport pick up until the actual hotel stay, everything goes smoothly!  The staffs were so helpful, polite, proactive and hospitable to their guests. Rooms are very neat and well maintained, they also have a rack for iron and you can borrow an iron from them anytime.  And not forgetting to mention that their buffet breakfast is UNMATCHED ü•òü•ôüç≤ you‚Äôll have variety of options to full your stomach in almost a whole day.

Michael John,"I had a remarkable stay at Quest Hotel and Conference Center Cebu where the concierge and attendants displayed exceptional hospitality, even allowing us to check in an hour early and storing our luggage while we waited for our pristine and impeccably clean room, which was a delight. The only suggestion I have for improvement would be to consider adding Netflix to the television options, as the available channels were limited. Nonetheless, the outstanding service and impeccable rooms make this hotel highly recommendable for anyone seeking a top-notch stay in the area, and I eagerly anticipate my return in the future."

Anne Roth A,"I had an exceptional 19-day stay at Quest Hotel Cebu with my family. The experience was truly memorable, thanks to the dedicated staff and impeccable service. Our family thoroughly enjoyed the daily breakfast, skillfully supervised by Sir Job.  The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the birthday party for my father, organized flawlessly with the assistance of Sir Yoyong, the F&B manager. The event was a success, accommodating our relatives and showcasing the hotel's commitment to making special occasions truly remarkable.  Miss Joyce and Sir Cesar took care of our stay and accommodation, ensuring our comfort and satisfaction throughout. We are incredibly grateful for the warm hospitality and personalized attention we received.  Thank you, Quest Hotel Cebu, for making our stay"
Mansoor Ali Z,"It is a pleasant experience every time we stay at the hotel, as the services are always excellent and the property is clean as always. Location is very convenient if you want to avoid any horrible traffic."
Nel,1.  We were told to wait for the room as they're still setting up the extra bed (with paid extra person charge).  but when we entered the room there was no extra bed and we had to call room service to set it up.   2.  Before booking I contacted the hotel via FB messenger to inquire about extra person charge (16 years old).  I was told that rate per night  is 1200 no breakfast or 1800 with breakfast - but upon checking in we were obliged by receptionist Shao to pay for the extra with breakfast as according to him it is required for extra person to have breakfast.. I asked twice and told him that I know it's not required but he insisted that it is required... I don't know who's not telling the truth (your messenger admin or the receptionist?)  3.  We're required to have breakfast

Der Genie√üer V,"My stay at the Quest Hotel and Conference Center in Cebu was an absolutely outstanding experience that I am delighted to share. Over a period of ten days, I had the privilege of enjoying the exceptional hospitality and top-notch service of this hotel.  Erica truly stood out to me. Her tireless diligence and constant dedication are remarkable. She was always on the move, ensuring that everything in the restaurant was in perfect order, all with remarkable discipline. Her dedication and commitment are palpable and made my stay even more enjoyable.  Franz is a true asset to the hotel. His consistent friendliness and sincere efforts to provide guests with the best possible service impressed me. His regular coffee service and unobtrusive inquiries about my well-being made me feel"
