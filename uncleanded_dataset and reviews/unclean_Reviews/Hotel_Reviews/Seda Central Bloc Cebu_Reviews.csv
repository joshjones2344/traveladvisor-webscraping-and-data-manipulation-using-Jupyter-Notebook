michaelciel,"Currently 2 weeks into a 5 week stay and as on our previous visit we are thoroughly impressed.  The two bedroom fully serviced apartment is modern and well appointed. Comfy bed and living areas along with two large bathrooms and laundry.  Centrally located in IT Park with supermarket, shopping mall and endless restaurants, cafes and fast food outlets on your doorstep.  Hotel Restaurants are very good and reasonably priced. Food is delicious, very well prepared with endless variety. Outside dining offered on the rooftop along with pool and gym.  The service is second to none in Cebu and is world class. After all a hotel no matter how well presented is nothing without warm, welcoming , friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Also when you are on a long stay in a hotel it is a big test"
alwaystravelsf,"Not a High End Luxury hotel but almost there!  The positive is it’s very clean, quality of finishes very polished and staff excellent and friendly!  Also the location is great as it’s connected to the Ayala Central Block mall.  Lots of restaurants/bars nearby and also Sugbo Mercado.  Room was great and had the 1 bdr apartment which very affordable.   On the negative side is the on-site restaurant breakfast buffet is not good imo.  Many items had run out and not replaced, food isn’t cooked very well and mostly cold.  Many guests will open the holding container and leave open.  Also egg station specialty is eggs sunny side up but they’re always cold even after they just make them.    Swimming pool adequate but kinda small it’s on roof.  So understandable, gym very small, can hear"
jayford l,We stayed at Seda IT Park for vacation and I really had fun during our stay. Everything is accessible from malls to food park. Staffs are great and warmth welcoming especially Nathan who assisted us from check-in and check-out. He gave us a very nice IT Park view and a complimentary drink at the bar. Thank you Nathan and to all the friendly staff! We'll surely be back this year for my grandma's birthday.
Adventure47542725541,"Great people and very friendly.  At the bar I met Emil and he doing very good Job and also at the Miso buffet resto, I met Kingswel he entertain really well , friendly and hard working. Over all , all staff is doing great. Also i can see ,The lady manager , she was doing very good job for helping her staff at the Miso Resto."
Bby L,"the nightly fare is well rewarded with a fantastic experience. this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in anywhere. Everything except the pool deck are wonderful. Unfortunately the tiles used at the pool washroom entrance are very slippery. Why hasn't the hotel removed and replaced them? I slipped, and the guard said, we have already told management about the inappropriate tiles. so, you know about this. Change the tiles. It is not a big job."
Clair D,"Everything is great and very accessible to malls and park. Me and my colleagues would surely choose it again next time we visit Seda. Thanks to Nathan, for your accommodating and helping us through your services."
Michiko N,"Stayed with my auntie for two nights in a two bedroom, and our stay was great! the service was awesome! Our room was supposed to come with a washer and dryer but only came with a dryer, so they offered us complimentary laundry service. One of the servers was exceptional and incredible with his service (thanks Kingswell!) and he made our breakfast time super enjoyable! Great food too!! Loved everything about our stay!"
Curious17005830904,"Superb inn. Excellent service the room was big, clean, and had everything we needed. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious; The buffet had a very large selection. I had the opportunity to speak with the telephone operators at night because I was having a bad day. They were extremely accommodating and friendly, and I would like to commend them for their excellent service. I believe their names are Diana, Kyla, and Kiara. The location is excellent! right adjacent to the shopping center and I would recommend this hotel to my friends.  Seda, thank you!"
Godxxx01,"This place is great.  The people are really helpful BUT i find it a bit strange to put 2 trainees just standing the whole day by the entrance to greet the hotel guests.  I find it a bit inhumane. I think their talent be use better by really training them. We got an upgrade with a stunning view of city. Not just a room but a BIG 1-bedroom APARTMENT with a functioning washing machine and separate dryer.   The pool was great on the rooftop but the bar is being built, that was a bummer.  I checked our the roof top bar in the evening.  Nice view and vibes and good offers to choice.  Unfortately, it closed really early at  midnight. Highly recommended in the middle of the new spot in Cebu city, the IT PARK with great going out scene and never sleeps due to the overwhelming presence of"
John Alexander Q,"The building feels very brand new. I got a one-bedroom and it was well laid out. The view from the room was also nice. My room had a kitchenette, dining table, couch, and lots of space.   If you are renting a car with driver or have your own car, the parking area exit is next to the drop-off point, so there is really not much wait for your pick-up.  Breakfast was a let down, it was purely Filipino and nothing great. This needs real menu improvement.  Overall I had a great stay."
RamonStinges,"It’s a relatively new hotel but its rooms are already deteriorating. Cleanliness is not what I expected and had 3 cockroaches in my room. Staff is not very engaging and take all the complaints and suggestions for granted, as if they are you used to it hearing the same thing over and over again. The only highlights are location and breakfast."
Galasheeng S,We had a great stay in here comfy and cozy. Commend to Ritchell and Frances for assisting us during check in and transfer of room for my mom and sis. And also to Jomalie for attending to us during our breakfast. Thank you everyone.
CMarie L,"We stayed at Seda Central Bloc for at least a month and experienced the best of the best! Everyone was so helpful and nice. Service with a smile! My sister and myself now know that there is nowhere else best to stay but here.  Their apartment style rooms equipped with washer and dryer was a great perk. Rooms were clean always and food was great!   But what was best of all? The people that worked there.. Razel, Kingswell, Nelson, Charlie, etc (there are  so many other names and please forgive me if I have missed mentioning them as my old age memory has caught on :-) )- —we came to know most of them and their impeccable service. From the Bellman, to their front desk, the housekeeping and to the breakfast team! Thank you! Thank you!! Thank you! For making us feel so at home! A home"
Ellery,"As a person with Autism traveling with a dad with physical disability and a senior mom, I have nothing but praises for this hotel. From the moment we got picked up at the airport on 01/27/23, I knew that we would be in great hands. Both gentlemen refused to let us lift a finger. Upon arrival at the hotel & seeing where it’s located ( in Cebu’s I.T. Park), I felt that the location was bang on. When we arrived, the security welcomed us and a bellman acted in seamless haste making us feel like royalty. We wede guided to the 5th floor where the hotel lobby is actually at. Julie of the Front Desk team and every single person of that team during our entire 6 night/7 day stay were not only professional but also very kind. We were given suite 702, my parents 903, my sister and her"
michaelciel,"Wow what a fantastic hotel, located in IT park.  We stayed for a month in a two bedroom apartment and could not have been happier. The apartment comes with two bathrooms, lounge, dining room and kitchen. Expert daily housekeeping by a friendly and efficient team of attendants.  Daily breakfast buffet is first class with local delicacies along with all the western favourites. Great value lunch and dinner buffets along with al a carte menu and because you are in the heart of the city you have 24 hour restaurants along with fast food that you can venture out for have delivered. Loved the bar on the top floor with nightly entertainment along with tasty food and delicious cocktails and a good wine list.  Direct access to shopping centre and supermarket.  Last but most importantly the"
Mykie Louise P,"Our stay at Seda IT Park was by far the best staycation we ever had. WHY?  The room: Surpassed our expectations. It had everything we needed, specially the kitchen. What we saw live was even better than the pics online. We give it a full-on 10!  The staff: They were truly wonderful! From check-in, to renting the hotel vehicle, to breakfast buffets, to room service, uuuup until we checked out, certified: NO HASSLE! SMOOTHE STAY. We thank Frances Marionne from the front desk, and Rachel from the breakfast buffet, the guy who drove us to the airport, and to the wonderful staff that gave us great service, KUDOS!  Will choose SEDA IT Park again for another great stay in Cebu, thanks!"
Gio A,"Posting this to help in the fight against diseases especially covid-19. Cleanliness/Housekeeping in this hotel is very bad. We feel unsafe when it comes to cleanliness/health and anti-covid19 standards.   Upon checkin: 1.) Toilet bowl lid is very dirty with urine probably from previous guest. We called for a cleaner right away. Questionable anti-covid19 standards!!  2.) Lots of small moths flying inside the room!  During the night: 3.) We noticed blood stains on one of the pillows. Yuck!  And btw, do you really not have hand towel available in the room? Or forgotten again by your questionable housekeeping/cleaning team? Even cheap hotels have one.   Urine, blood, and flying insects are not acceptable. Please help fight against covid-19. Hope you improve."
Rhon Adam L,"While I was walking on the aisle of the restaurant, a man named Felipe approached me with a pleasing appearance that makes my conscience wants to dine in. I thank Felipe for being an extraordinary attendant to me and satisfy my cravings."
Enlyy,"Stayed for 3 weeks.  2 weeks in One bedroom apartment. It was big and comfortable. Also in the room, there is washing machine and dryer.  1 week in Deluxe room. Cozy and comfortable.  Buffet is also nice, service is good too. Thank you"
A O,"One, if not THE best, hotel in Cebu we’ve  been to so far. Location is good with easy access to the mall, suite room has good lay out, clean & perfect for family. The swimming pool deck had great view , breakfast buffet was great (lots of choices!)  with good view outside the window.  Staff were professional and attentive to guests. The 3 bedroom suite was so worth it with its amenities and location. We had a great time despite the rainy weather we had that day."
Louieboytoy,"5 star for me!  Seda never fails! Ive been to Seda Nuvali for several times and Seda Cebu is equally impressive!  Staff are friendly! Amenities ✔️ Location is just walking distance to the malls and my office ✔️ Room is very spacious  What they can improve on is their room wifi as it often disconnects.  But over-all, I will surely be back!"
Jen D,"Had the best stay ever at this hotel. Customer service over all is outstanding.    Everyone has been very pleasant, courteous and always ready to help.  Special shoutout to the F&B team, Rose - manager, Francis - supervisor, and the rest of the staff especially Razel.   They have quite a spread for their breakfast buffet and food is tasty but they can add a little bit of variety every now and then. 😊  Room is very clean and cozy.  You get cleaning service every day of the week.  They're generous with their bottled water service (comes free with your room reservation) unlike some hotels where they scrimp on this service.    I would definitely be back here.  😊"
Inna Marie S,"Seda hotel is one of my favorite staycation hotel to go to in Cebu. Aside from being so accessible, the staff here was so nice & very friendly esp. Nathan who happily assisted me during my check in & Wengie who assisted us during our visit to the straight up bar. Very much appreciated! The food here is also superb & if you want to have a chill night with your friends they have a perfect place for that! I really got to relax after my long week of work, a prefect Staycation indeed! Highly recommend! Thank you Seda & I will definitely be back!"
Angelica,"Highly recommended hotel very accessible, amaze how clean and spacious their room, the staff are very friendly.

The location was very accessible and would like to give a special thanks to Nathan and Wengie for giving their best accomodation for our stay never been accomadated that way before really love it very friendly. Will be probably book another stay soon."
SCQ,"I've stayed in many Seda hotels before. They're good but still had minor hiccups. Seda Central Bloc,however, beats them all out in terms of hospitality and efficiency. It may not be the biggest and fanciest among all, but it is the best for me.  Check-in was supposed to be at 2:00PM but since our room was already ready, front desk officer Ritchelle let us have an early check-in at 12:00 noon free of charge. On top of this, she was very warm, friendly, and she even remembered me on my last day. Front desk officer Nathan was also very helpful. I had some minor requests and he  gladly asissted me. Housekeeping was also very efficient. Went out for 2+ hours and when we came back our room was already made up. Lastly, check-out was such a breeze. Props to Loren for this. It was the"
Journey217504,"Washer and dryer need I say more?  It’s perfectly located next to Ayala Mall, Starbucks Reserve is within walking distance.  Gym is decent for a good workout, pool nice both located on the 17th floor with an amazing view of the city!!! Everyone at the hotel eager to always help."
Royce A,"Great city view. Room size is above average meaning bigger than other deluxe Seda rooms we’ve been to.  Misto resto is with a great view but it can be easily get full and refill takes time especially the bacon.   There is direct access to the Mall which is a good thing however there is not much yet in the Central Block Mall but the basics are there.  It could have been 5 star if not for the front desk who called in the middle of the night 10:30pm. They interrupted our sleep for a mistake.  We were asleep when they called to ask if we’re done with the iron and board which we previously requested but declined because there was no available.  Other than that, it was a great 2N/3D. We’ll comeback when in town."
mmvelasquez,"Location is great, mall restaurants very safe. Very clean and everyone is very nice. Breakfast buffet is very bad nothing at the right temperature, made to order eggs are just eggs pre made sitting under a heat lamp. When asked for fresh made to order eggs they refused to do so. Pork products not cooked thoroughly or very fresh. One morning bugs in cheese. Needless to say they need better management of breakfast buffet from the kitchen out."
Clow,"This is actually the second time I’ve stayed in this hotel, and both times the experience was well spent. The room was very clean and spacious. The staff are very friendly. The breakfast buffet was what I was looking forward to the most. Highly recommended and I will definitely visit again."
