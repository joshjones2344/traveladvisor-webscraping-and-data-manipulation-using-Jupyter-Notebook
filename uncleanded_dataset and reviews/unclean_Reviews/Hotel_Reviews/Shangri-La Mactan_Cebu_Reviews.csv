Mel L,"Great view to the ocean and to the pool. Lots of activities for adults and kids. Kudos to Lyn, Rolly, Sir Jayton, Coach Jo and the Dragon boat team! They were nice and friendly, took good care of our family and we had a really great time! Also, I would like to mention Chef Loel, Katrina and Beth for the wonderful dinner in Tea of Spring. Lastly, thank you housekeeping team for keeping our room clean ❤️ We'll definitely be back again!"
KimD,"We love it here!  We’ve stayed a few times and now visit regularly since we have moved to the island because it is so comfortable, welcoming, and relaxing!   Everything is excellent, the staff & service, the rooms, the landscaping,  the amenities, the shops, and the restaurants.    Even though it is always full, it does not seem crowded since the grounds are spacious, extremely well-maintained, and well-designed.  If you’re vacationing, there is no reason to leave the property with all the activities that are available, from sitting at one of the many pools or the beautiful beach, learning to dive, snorkeling, working out in the health club, feeding the fish in the fish sanctuary, paddleboarding, kayaking, playing putt-putt, golfing (chipping only, not a full course), doing"
Mike G,"Being going here 20 years + enjoying happy he and having dinner and celebrating birthdays and Christmas, New Year plus entertaining friends and business associates. WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT NOW THEY HAVE STOPPED THE HAPPY HR THURSDAY FRIDAY SATURDAY SUNDAY.  Many people disappointed at this bad decision and have moved to other venues. For sure as losing out on food sales.  The staff are still great and will miss my time there alot. Seems like Shangri la greed overtook sense."
Dave A,I was dining with my girlfriend at the observatory. We were served by Klerk who did a phenomenal job. The night was special as I proposed to my girlfriend. The food and service were definitely top tier
엘린 J,This is my second visit to Shangri-La I learned some languages here and greeted the staff. They were very kind with smiles.  Romnick was particularly kind and touching. The facilities were of course clean and special. We also need to show a kind smile to our staff. I'll come to Shangri-La again. I'm surprised.

금 금,We have a wonderful time with my family playing mini golf competition lol. Alain guide supervised our game with other family and it was so exciting. The game  was just like combination of golf only putter and billiards. Also he gave us complimentary coupon for two champions. Thank you for the guide and shangri la resort for making that good activity. Hope to come back here.
shopsbh,"We've been returning to the Mactan Shangri-la for 17 years, and we continue to love it and discover something new each time. We loved staying in the Ocean Wing with a balcony view of the beautiful waters and enjoyed the Club Lounge. We missed the family happy hour by the pool that they used to have, but everything else was just the way we had remembered, from the kids' play areas and swimming pool fun to the fantastic service. We look forward to a future return."
Aj C,Amazing dinner at Cowrie Cove tonight. It was my our anniversary so we decided to get a private dinner. They go all out. The chef put together a some of the best seafood and steak dishes we have ever had. Klerk was our waiter and we couldn’t have had a better experience with him. He was attentive but not overbearing. 10/10
Reixne M,Shangri-la mactan is by far the best resort i’ve stayed in. It’s just simply a magical paradise. It is so romantic. The staff were so accomodating too from the receptionist to when we stayed in the beach and in the pool. Richie was just soooo accomodating and kind enough to make sure our food and drinks orders are served well. 👌 and the smokey black burger in buko restaurant was fire and by the far the best burger i had. The gin and tonic hits the spot 😜 The breakfast at tides has a wide array of food selection. Our room was great with an amazing view from our veranda. I’ll surely go back with my fiancee and my family and his family 🥰🥰🥰
Rk E,The beach is nice the service is good and the food also all the waiters are attentive and very good view very good food. Nice beach and nice swimming pool. I wanna go back to shangrila always. Thankyou!
Ab C,The pillows are good. The service is great. There are nice people. I was able to go to the pool and everything was clean and set in tone. The food in Tides was so delicious. The beach is so nice. Keep up the good work!

Challaine,"Loved the views from our hotel room! People were very welcoming and hospitable, especially Alvin who took good care of us at the buffet. I celebrated my 21st here with good memories and no regrets!!!!"
AJ B,"Great views from hotel balcony and private beach… EXCELLENT service from May and especially Alvin. Despite the pressure and loads of customers during the morning buffet breakfast, Alvin made sure to serve each one of us properly with great personality! May properly served my family and I during my sister’s 21st birthday for our dinner buffet and made sure that we get the quality experience. Will definitely come back here again and am really hoping to see Alvin, May and other employees again!"
Quest01662934255,"The places in the hotel are very well managed and user friendly. The workers, the security, the waiters and waitresses are all very polite, helpful and nice. It is the first time I meet this highly trained people in other hotels. The waitresses in Acqua are excellent, Jovy and Maria are excellent and commendable!"
Nel,1.  I left my jacket(my fault) on the chair at the balcony and reported it couple of hours after I checked out (phone call and email) but was told that it's not there and not in the lost and found dept as well.  I am very sure it's there as it rained a day before and I have to hung it there as it got wet.    2.  The girl serving the welcome drink bypassed us. She offered welcome drinks to the guest infront and behind us but not to us (even though we arrived first).  She prioritizes foreign guests over locals which is so discriminating.  My kids we're waiting for their turn to be offered a drink but this girl didn't bother because she was so busy looking for foreign-looking guests.  This kind of person should't be on the frontline.
Ian Chan,Amazing experience and hospitality by Shangri-La Mactan. Thanks to Val ate and her team of the hardest working staff I've seen on any hospitality business. Will definitely come back in the future!  Maraming Salamat pamilya sa Pilipinas!!
raymondd841,"Great hotel! Lots of dining options. The beach, though a bit rocky, has a lot of fishes roaming around which makes it exciting. It has a deep pool and entertainment center, with mini golf, tennis and billiards. The Chinese restaurant was great (thanks Rochelle for the assistance)! There is lechon every night at the main restaurant. Lastly, the Chi Spa experience is heavenly! Worth the price! Kudos to Fhelma and Noemi for the wonderful massage!"
WHATEVER33,"Great stay with kids and friends. Adventure zone staff great with kids and the quest given kept them occupied.  Lots of fishes in the ""beach"" Breakfast and lunch buffet were both good.  Great quick escape from manila.  Enjoyed the yoga class too.  Decided to go again for quick escape next month One peeve is they did not credit my shang circle rewards points"
