Rod Talbot,"I would describe our stay at Solea Mactan Resort Cebu as, at best, mediocre. A summary of our experience is as follows.   1) Staff: Very good! Attentive. Polite. Very helpful.  2) F&B: Very good.  3) Pools: Good! Except that the main water attraction was closed for maintenance until the second last day of our 6 night stay.  4) Rooms: We had two rooms. One for us and one for parents and cousins. In a word, the rooms are tired. They need an upgrade, especially the bathrooms! The shower and basin are old. The shower heads are not comfortable, at all. The water in the bathroom is salty. We did not receive an explanation as to why this is. Hot water in the bathroom is sporadic. The door to our hotel room did not close smoothly (the edge needs to be shaved).   I believe Solea Mactan"
Raja M,"This hotel is more than 4 stars hotel you will experience the 5+ stars if you booked a room , along with the best crew at earth restaurant specialy Ivony she was so friendly  and most welcoming also all the staff was friendly. The rooms are so clean with comfy beds  Astonishing  seaview from the balcony all over the beach. A rooftop bar is available for late night drinks and good vibes music to relax after a long day . I loved this place and i would recommend it so much."

Tourist02008437198,Best staycation we had with the family. They have many swimming facilities which my nieces truly enjoyed. Plus the front desk were very accommodating and helpful with our inquiries. The ambiance of the resort is so relaxing. Truly a home away from home  Definitely will go back here and will stay more nights! 😍
Kishna S,"Upon our arrival is Solea Mactan I already informed them 2 days before our booking date ( August 26, 2023) that we will be having an early checked in since our arrival in the airport is too early. From a very tiring travel I was disappointed when i got into the front office when they told me that we need to wait until our room is ready, and we waited from 10am until 11:30 am for our room l, we we’re told that the room we book is still not ready and that pisses me off and my husband.   While waiting for our room, we decided to go in the bar to have some drinks to cool down and snacks, the only person that makes our day less tiring and greeted us with a very warm welcome and very positive smile was Blance upon our dined in bar despite of him being busy every time someone"

travlmom7,"The parking was too far from the entrance but it had direct access to the elevator for the rooms in the new building. The layout of the resort felt like it was not planned well. From the front desk to the new building for the rooms, you’d have to pass through two ramps that are exposed under the sun or rain. During our stay it was rainy so we passed that several times and it was always wet and muddy. No staff in sight to maintain the area. This also made the elevators always wet and muddy. I had to call maintenance for them to at least mop the floors of the elevators. The corridor to our room felt old and not maintained well with dirty windows, broken mirrors, finger / hand prints on glass walls. When you enter the room you’d instantly feel the floor to be sticky. There wasn’t"
sand b,"Too much stress in 3days!  -Check in time is 3pm but they managed to checked us in at 4pm! 1hr late? Hello!! Rooms should have been ready bcoz check out is 11, plenty of time to get it done!  -no waiter service by the pool, you have to walk all the way to the lobby to order drinks/snacks!! Not convenient for us specially we have kids - go somewhere save yourself the stress :)"
Grace San Juan,"NOT for Seniors. Resort is farthest end of island. DONT book online, they assign lousiest room with view of garage ( where the delivery cars fumes ), Book directly, ONLINE booking removes privileges, Airport Shuttle, BF, No Seniors Discount. When we arrived, SURPRISED to find they Offer half price to their locals ( they call it sudden ANNIVESARY), with lots freebies ! LOTS locals crowd the resort--mostly speak Cebuano dialect. MOving around is hassle, Great if you have little kids. Dirtiest Beachfront"
Mary Jed B,"The food are superb, place is very nice and I really appreciate the service of Mario and Lovely they have the great and very professional service. Very accommodating and they even did extra mile for us. Definitely we will come back."
jeah banate m,"We had our best accommodation at Solea last week. Me and my friends decided to have summer outing and spend overnight to relax and skip the chaotic world that we are living (especially from work). Solea became our stress reliever and they have a lot of activities that you may enjoy beyond expectations. Referring to water activities that gives us wonderful experience (aquaventure with big bucket of waters, inflatables, stand up paddle and kayaking), and the foods are worth it. We are so welcomed by the staffs and they are so kind with smile on their faces 🥰. Guest Services are well accommodating specially for our concerns, they assisted us well and provided our request in less than 10 minutes. Already recommended to each of our families and will be visiting again soon."
Jane B,"The entire resort is Perfect for couple and Family. The breakfast is superb, there’s a lot food choices. Our room is big, we had fluffy pillows not 2 but 4😍. We enjoyed a lot during our stay, good for staycation.  In addition, we had a chill night in their rooftop restau bar which you can view the entire Island."
Mika O,"I just want to share my experience how accommodating Solea Mactan Resort is. When I went there, it was very relaxing and chill. They also have a lot of enjoyable facilities. Overall I was really satisfied to their service."
GoPlaces39975854287,"The solea mactan hotel was very pleasant it was clean and cozy.. The hotel team has always been friendly, patient and helpful i recommend this hotel also very nice place. The service was exceptional as well."
Menchel S,"Personalen är trevliga men det saknas kompetens & service känsla. Fruskosten  är de värsta jag har varit med om, kön stryker sig 100 meter till frukost entren. Väl inne efter ca 30 min väntetid, så kommunicerar personalen med walkie talkie på hög volym som skär i öronen. Övrigt var frukost ok. Finns bara 2 hissar vid entren och de är varma o kvavt liksom gångarna till rummen.  Its strange: We were asked to email Solea info desk confirmation that agoda emailed  us. They apparently  ask all guests to do this as agoda isn’t linked with their system. Where is the GDPR?🤣 It was irritating so far no one asked us to mail the booking cfrm from agoda to their info desk. Not even Bayfront🤣.  The Spa treatment in Solea is superb! Floor is always wet in the lobby as well as the elevators"
JASON R,"I had a great time spending my days off at Solea with my wife. I had a good experience staying there. Good food, nice ambiance and the staffs were very accomodating. The pool was nice too. I highly recommend Solea ❤️."
delilah m,Beautiful experience/clean resort/nice amenities/courteous staff/sumptuous breakfast/hotel rate just okey/ will definitely go back.  Only one comment:  see-through partition between sleeping areaThese are some of the most dangerous borders in the world... and bathroom not a good idea even if it has a cover.  The cover should be made permanent - not just a venetian blind.  Privacy is topmost priority for me.
JS R,"Josem, Bryan, Rose, Roxam, Vanz, Lovely, Hea, Joyce, Mario, Rolpan all provided excellent service. The food was great, but they really elevated the experience with their kindness and quick service!!!!!"
현지 박,"Everything was really good except for the towels and bed sheet. There were many Koreans so if you don’t speak Korean, no worries.  I did enjoy food and drinks especially the pizza at the rooftop bar. Hi Alexis and Mario :)"
Jeremy B,"I had a great time in Solea Mactan. From the amenities to the staff as well as the food, they offer the best so far comapred to other expensive resorts in Mactan Cebu. My family, especially my little one enjoyed the water park. I would definitely consider coming back to this resort when I return to Cebu again."
huntertwinkle,"Had my birthday dinner and reserved a private room.   The facilities were ok but too crowded,  especially outside the function area. Many pools to choose from but the crowd made it un inviting to use the facilities   Didn’t go by the beachside as it was pouring cats and dogs"
Jonas Bing,"I was planning to give this place 5 stars, but I changed my mind due to an experience I will tell you about. I normally don't write anything negative, especially not about a nice place like this, but this experience was just to stupid. We been to this place a couple of times, it's really excellent. Nice rooms, nice service, great food, outstanding pool area.  We been eating in the restaurant several times, when we stay here before and also this time. They really have a high standard. We had a very nice and serviceminded waiter named Hermes, he's nice, smiling, and understanding, Solea, you better keep this guy😊 Today we want to spend the day on the hotel and let the kids enjoy the facilities. We have a family room, and we get a voucher for 4 persons (already a little stupid,"
Joe M,"Solea Macatan  Staff, are fantastic but most noticable is the staff at Sandy Beach are exceptional.. The Capt,  Mano as well as Joseph, Joshus and (Navone) (my spelling is lousy, my apology) are the best. Awesome personality awesome service. They will do all they can to ensure your visit as well as eating pleasure is like none other anywhere. They all deserve a high praise from management"
Heewon L,"여기너무 생각보다 너무 좋았습니다. 시설은 그냥 저냥 그랬는데 가적단위로 오기에 너무 좋아요. 수영장도 너무 좋고 애들이 놀기에 넘  좋아요.  The staff were quite friendly. Everyone made me feel so good and the dinner was pretty good.
