Yohei K,"I recently stayed at a resort hotel called The reef. The cocktails served at the hotel bar, especially the East Jungle, were excellent, and the original food was very good. Our English is not perfect, but the hotel staff was sincere and flexible in considering our requests regarding our room and luggage. The location of the hotel was excellent and we enjoyed the clean sea and the pool with its spectacular view. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
maricris g,"It was a great place to go with family. The room is big good for 3 persons. It has balcony which you can see the beach. Wifi is fast.Buffet was fine,for me t‚Äôwas not that huge choices but the pastries is superb. Lobby is so clean and furnitures is comfortable by renowned furniture maker Kenneth Cobonpue.Beach closes at 5pm and pool closes at 7pm.."
Denise S,I think the best highlight of it all was the staff esp the reception. They managed to fulfill our request by upgrading my parents' room to one with an awesome view. They understood that one of my family member's were celebrating their birthday here so it was a nice touch that they gave us the room plus the option to check out late! The whole place was clean and up to date (I think this place is relatively new). Also helps that you're near Mactan Newtown so you have a ton of options to go out and eat
Leavel N,The sea view was spectacular.  The staff was very attentive and made us feel welcomed. I have already recommended to my friends and colleagues to stay at the Reef. Amazing time. I will visit again for sure
Yuka T,The infinity pool and all facilities they  offered to us was excellent. All staff has warm hospitality.  The shower annexed pool was a little cold for us. But it‚Äôs fine because except for that was great.
Grace R,"Our stay at The Reef was an unexpected phenomenal experience!  The hotel offered a relaxing atmosphere, the rooms were clean and spacious.  The breakfast selection offered a wide variety of sumptuous food, offering delicious selections of pure Filipino breakfast with an offering of menu palatable to other non Filipino guests.    The staff were all welcoming and friendly, with attention to our needs during our stay at your hotel.   Overall, our stay created long lasting positive and relaxing experiences that will encourage us to visit and stay at your hotel.   We plan to come back with our entire family including our children and grand children from the states.   The Reef is the place to be in Mactan Cebu."
Angel A,The breakfast is excellent. We also tried dinner and the food is delicious. We got a free room upgrade from deluxe to premier seaview with balcony. We are very lucky and thankful. They said they do room upgrades randomly and we were chosen. The room is very spacious with bath tub and balcony over looking the sea. The beach and the sea is great for swimming.
Angely A.,"Got a day tour to see if the rumors were true about this place having a good beach, and the rumors are true. The food was good and staff was really accomodating at the Kitchen. Special shoutout to Jaybee and Keith for making my stay enjoyable!  Hoping to stay here next time!"
hlcg6442,Very friendly and accommodating staff. The service is good and the breakfast buffet was really delicious. The amenities was satisfactory and kid friendly. The rooms were very spacious. Hope to be back someday.
Benedict H,The place was stunning and beautiful. There are a lot of instagramable parts so you can have a lot of pictures with you after the visit. All of the resort staff were very friendly up until we have checked out.
Lazy Days,"Very nice resort, as recently opened some final construction in common areas still ongoing but really enjoyed the stay.   Restaurant served really delicious food.  What makes the place amazing is its greatest asset, the staff. Big thank you to Rose in reception who is super sweet, Ariel at breakfast always ready with the coffee, and Mark T at the beach area. Hope to see you again!"
Henry_G99887,"I checked in for 8 days at the reef and was assisted by the warmest staff and crew. The view is sensational. The breakfast is superb. But what stood out the most is the concierge who assisted me since day one. He recommended restaurants and tourist spots. He was driving excellently, very unobtrusive and also the ride has always been smooth with Clint. Clint along with his team makes me wanna come back soon. I am from Hongkong, but while i was in Cebu. I felt like it was my second home. Kudos!!!  Also, suggestion: Please have a convenience or guest center and gym in your facility because it is dark and far to go out from the resort and any emergency necessity purchase might come in place. Doorbells on rooms would help too. all in all it was great but it would've been greater."
Emeni S,"Very good hotel with excellent staff specially Mr Clint Everything was perfect , room , restaurant , view etc  Thanks and see you soon  Amani & Amani  Un excellent hotel sur tous les plans  Merci √† tout le staff et sp√©cialement Mr Clint   A bient√¥t   Amani & Mohamed"
Dominic A,"I had a fantastic time staying at this resort. I enjoyed the amenities, swimming pool, massage and restaurant. Hotel staff were nice and friendly. I met one of the concierge, Clint, he was very helpful and assisted me with my stay and travels. I would highly recommend this resort. The room i stayed at was nice and clean."

Allan W,"This is our second time in 3 months staying at ‚ÄúThe Reef Island resort‚Äù in Mactan Lapu-Lapu city. We couldn‚Äôt wait to return since our first visit was so wonderful and memorable! From the moment you arrive at the resort you really feel like a VIP guest, not only yourself but your entire party will be treated equally special by all the staff. The resort in on a beautiful beach with many water activities in the sea, or you can just relax at one of the three magnificent pools. The resort is brand new and every inch is clean and breathtaking! The rooms are elegant and comfortable with great views of the sea and cityscape. The restaurant, coffee shop and room service food is great. All in all great place to vacation while in Cebu. I rate it as a 5 star resort comparable to other 5"

airaadna,"I visited the place last December and I couldn't help recommending it to my aunt and uncle when they visited CEBU last month. And now I brought my cousins here and we all love it! This resort is a well definition of a paradise! So clean, nice staffs and very nice ambiance! I have been to other 5 star hotels but this place is my most favorite! All the front desk staff are so sweet, the guards are all friendly and the restaurant staffs are all so genuine. Love the food here by the way! And now they have a bakery and a coffee shop! Big thanks to Sir Bryan Gerali for spoiling us. He always made sure that I and the girls will be all pampered. We've got our free massage! And boy, that was our first time and it feels so good. I wonder how many members of the family should I bring here?"
Mikaela E,"The best head and shoulder massage I‚Äôve ever had at the spa. Loyla who gave a wonderful deep pressure massage, I highly recommend.  The facilities where very relaxing and comfortable. Was also served a lemon/cucumber juice and a hot tea afterwards."
spice787,"I spent 9 wonderful days here, quiet, peaceful and very relaxxxing. Glenn the happy jovial manager could have been the host from Fantasy island as he can make things happen. His entire staff were fantastic and always popping up just when & wherever you needed them and with a big smile. Bakery/coffee shop food and staff = Great !  If things get too quiet, theres lots to do within a 10 min cab ride at other hotels or exploring Newtown shops etc. I enjoyed the private beach and just sitting looking over the infinity pool and watching the world slowly go by and the boats and para sailors. Never actually got around to exploring the other islands but maybe next time. And I didn't need a bank loan to stay here unlike the other surrounding resorts."
alanr,"The hotel is still in the soft opening phase I believe. Parked in the guest car park which is not yet finished.  Just stayed one night in a premium room with two double beds. Very spacious room with nice bath and shower. Nespresso machine included in the room. Had buffet breakfast which was nice with a reasonable selection and variety of food on offer.  Had lunch and dinner in ‚ÄúThe Kitchen‚Äù. The service was extremely slow, when ordering we were told the food would take 25 minutes, despite the fact the restaurant was almost empty. Drinks took equally long to arrive. However when the food did arrive it was excellent, very authentic Indonesian and Indian dishes. Hopefully the serving times will improve over time.  We had two massages in ‚ÄúThe Spa‚Äù , very good with a nice atmosphere."
Rob B,I did not know that this resort was undergoing a soft opening upon our visit. We had searched on Agoda and Orbitz and this place kept popping up.  Photos looked good and the rates seemed a good value. We booked 4 days 3 nights here in a standard room. Although Google maps took us off-roading we finally got on track and arrived safely. It's ashame we arrived after dark as you cant truly experience the beauty of the building or exterior architecture at night.  The bell-boys helped us unload our luggage and someone even valet parked our car for us. We went up to the lobby and the Interior Design was stunning.  It made me wonder what the rooms and the rest of the hotel was going to be like. We got checked in right away and up to our room with some cool funky bracelets.   My first
