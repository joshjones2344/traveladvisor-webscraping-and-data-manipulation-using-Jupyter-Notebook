DeSmetguy,"Leslie (Front Desk) and manager, Nino went above and beyond to modify and correct a prepaid reservation I mistakenly made a few months ago. Leslie was very pleasant, apologetic and corrected my mistake. Kudos to her! The hotel was also very clean and convenient. All other staff were also very good and responsive and respectful."
Godxxx01,"You literally see the hotel the moment you get out of the airport terminal.  Cross the not so busy road with your luggage in tow. No hassle reaching the reception in a 3 min zipp walk.  This is a old style Grandish hotel of the 70‚Äôs and need some updating here and there. I love the swimming pool area but hates the service there, normally takes at least half an hour for anything you order. As the resto is few floors up and there is no pool bar. I guess the hotel management focuses all their energies to the real money making part of this business??‚Ä¶ the casino attached to the hotel.  All can be better and has the potential to be a real TOP HOTEL of Cebu with a bit of TLC. One thing I happy about is they have also accorded the right price for the services they now offer without"
Irwin (INCOGNIT... S,"My wife and I have stayed at Waterfront Airport Hotel and Casino 5 times and can think of no better Hotel to stay at when we travel to Cebu. The entire staff is awesome, and they go out of their way to make you feel at home, When were last their in March, they were not able to do Buffets, which they have restarted. From our previous stays with the Buffets, we can assure you they are a great value for the cost of each of them. Furthermore, the food is fantastic. We look forward to staying there again in the future. Keep up the good work.  I  North Carolina, USA"
Bianca G,"From the moment we walked in the entrance if Waterfront Airport Hotel& Casino. we were thoroughly impressed. The interior decor was outdated yet warm and inviting and the personnel we encountered were all very pleasant and accommodating. The room was crisp and comfortable and wow, what a pleasant view at their poolside! We were surprised by it!  The food was ok, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the staff and How accommodating their are in our needs  Overall, what a wonderful stay and a Great Price.Special thanks to you for making all the arrangements for us. We thoroughly enjoyed it and appreciate all the work the hotel put into our visit. We would definitely recommend the Waterfront Airport Hotel as a great place to come to relax before"
rodellelay,"Minor fine tuning for Bell Boy, Security at the Main door and Resto closes at 8PM. Suggest if Lift is Not working, better close it or put a signage that it's not available.   Superb Rooms, Clean and very friendly front desk."
MihoTakeuchi,"Employees were very nice (Front Desk, Security, Housekeeping) and helpful, hotel followed health protocols. I had a great sleep and a great time. Thank you as well to Mr Ali Banting for the warm hospitality. I will be back for sure! :)"
Erick_Mark,Good environment and very relaxing spot to go in cebu. It gives an authentic kind of structure. A positive and fun people around the hotel. Truly one of the best in the country and in cebu city. My stay in the hotel will always be one of my best times their in cebu. It makes every moment memorable with family and friends. Especially when the place is really good.
heyycarolinelim,"If you want a hassle-free near airport accomodation, then this is the place!   Number one my list is their fluffy pillows and comfy sheets! Real fluffy. Try it to believe it! üòâ Second, is their new normal crate. I also loved how they provided it for the customer's peace of mind. Third, food!"
roxanneandoy,"Location is great, very close to the airport and they are providing free shuttle to airport. Their food is not that much costly and with generous serving. I asked to print a 2-page document and they charged me 58 pesos each page, quite expensive, some hotels offer printing services for free. But overall, it was great, staff are very accommodating and they allowed us for late check out."
stanedwards,Had a great time. We had a very clean room. Front desk staff were exceptional.  Great customer service. Restaurant food was excellent. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Beautiful hotel on the inside.
Markus,"This hotel is our go-to transit hotel. Cebu is in! It‚Äôs super close to the airport, facilities are well maintained. They even upgraded us to a villa overlooking the pool. Doreen at the front desk took her time to assist us with our reservation and was cheerful and wonderful!"
suegirard2019,The shower didn't work so I wasn't able to use it.   Service was excellent. I liked having a gym but I think it should have opened earlier than 7 am.  I am vegetarian and was not able to find enough food at lunch or dinner to make it worth the cost of the buffet.
Anne!,"Our flight out of Cebu got cancelled due to a typhoon, and since I was sick of slumming it in hostels we decided to stay a night here. What an excellent decision. We booked through Booking.com, and our room was upgraded on check-in to something that was larger than my apartment at home! Minibar beers were reasonably priced (unlike the Sofitel Plaza in Manila). Staff were all very friendly and food was good. Comfortable bed with all the amenities. The only fault is its location, it is only really convenient for the airport and if you are using a driver for all of your activities. There is not much within walking distance to explore, and apart from eateries there is not much on Mactan island in respect to bars."
RDesilets,"Stayed here 2 nights before departing Cebu.  Excellent accommodations.  Very comfortable and quiet.  Tons of amenities!  In room safe, stocked refer, excellent wifi.  Dinner buffet is out of this world.  Lots of different cuisine to choose from.  Will definately stay there again."
daniellw2017,"I was supposed to meet my wife there but the typhoon kept her stranded in Mindanao... It was and always has been my favorite place to stay ,because the service,hotel quality,and location to the airport..."
MyronMelliza,Most of the front desk personel are friendly but not all. One in particular i talked to when i got in.  When i asked the security for a taxi he wasnt in the mood i guess. He just got me one without one word to me.
debcafe411,"Huge rooms, very clean rooms and premises, super friendly staff, wide selection at buffet breakfast, superb airport transfer service, hardworking concierge and security crews, and adorable canine security staff."
Jovie143,"This is a place to be when your staying in Cebu. The place is nice and clean, beds are so comfortable to sleep. we didn't have any issue at all. They even have a restaurant next to the Lobby. Food is AMAZING!! Can't wait to go back again!"
R3710IEjamesd,"I make monthly trips to the Waterfront Hotel and Casino, am never disappointed. Year after year I am able to depend on a great stay. Always relaxing. Great staff from top to bottom. My favorite place to get away from it all, just a fine atmosphere all around..  Thank you sir Ben, Ms Sharm, Ms Olive, Sir Kirk, and all the rest. too many to name all here, will add more next time. thank you everyone. see you around Christmas time."
ladonnamercado,This is nice hotelhotel I will be recommend to my friends and I want to stay again with my friend to more experience at the hotel God bless to all staff ang keep up the good work I'm happy to stay with a short time. .
mborromeo,"The hotel is next to the national airport and a few blocks from the international airport that is why we always stayed there. The buffet meals are delicious and the staffs are courteous and friendly. One peeve is, they always have one roll or halfway roll of toilet paper that‚Äôs thin, so ask for extra. Besides that everything is good."
zobellemsb,Our experience was awesome. My kids enjoyed and love the Family room we had. A great Family place to stay. Will definitely be back again in our next Family vacation and will definitely recommend it to our Family and Friends here in Australia.

Staff are friendly and the hotel is clean. They have a nice pool to relax. Shuttle to the airport are on time and free!"
Trip18368549554,I highly recommend this hotel. Got a free upgrade to 7th floor ambassador suite.  Absolutely amazing room huge great actual king size bed great shower so much space cold air.  Very convenient to airport 5 minute shuttle ride.   Also breakfast buffet is unbelievable and free.
Footprints641230,This is a very nice hotel.  I love the location across the street from the airport.  This makes it easy to get some sleep when I get in on a late flight and gives my fiancee a place to stay when I fly out on a late flight.
Robert86364,"Overall the hotel is very nice and clean, breakfast is good but a little expensive Bad thing is that we were charged for 1 Coke from the mini bar in our room but we did not drink any and this has happened before"
masaponkichi,Controlling the room temperature was very difficult for us. It's too cold for us. So we always prepare our own pajama.  But thank you very much for upgrading our room.We really appreciated your kind treatment.
melvinmerlu,Only 1 roll of toilet paper supplied in the room. Personnel were pleasant. Variety of food selections and were excellent. Customer servicing was exceptional. Location was great. Security is topnotch. I stayed one night only and so far everything was alright except we cannot find extra roll or rolls of toilet paper.

r0b052,When in the Philippines - I always stay at Waterfront Airport Hotel. So close to airport and the place and staff are amazing. I arrive and greeted like one of the family. Would highly recommend this hotel.
imfegarcia,My mom had an amazing experience staying at your hotel. She said employees were friendly and accommodating. Thank you for taking care of her through your free shuttle service from the domestic airport to your hotel and from the hotel to Cebu Mactan International Airport. Her travel went easier.
evarias2019,"during our stay at room 103 for 2 nights, there was an ongoing repair in room 101 and we smell the paint that makes our sleep very uncomfortable. the ref was not working so i had to call for service to replace the unit. it should have been checked before we checked in. it was my 3rd time to WFMac but it was the first time i had a sleep discomfort."
cwmccabe98,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Waterfront. The place was nice, clean, & fun. The staff went out of their way to make sure that we were comfortable from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. I would DEFINITELY rate this place as a5 star!!!"
TaintSaint,"Stay was great. Only 5 minutes from the airport. We stayed there for the beginning and end of our trip. Really convenient for redeye flights. Buffet was amazing (especially the Tocino, a must try.)   We were upgraded to a deluxe room free of charge on our first night. The hot water wasn‚Äôt working, but they quickly fixed it, thanks."
dalcoriza,"Based on 3 day staying at your hotel, overall rating is Excellent. Excellent in terms services, amenities and location of hotel.   Recommendation: Please provide an Flat iron on each room in order to iron our clothes."
madamedelmas,We stayed many times in this hotel for the past 2 yrs. I love how the staff manage the checking in and even upgraded us to a bigger room for the same price. Feeling the comfort away from home. Highly recomended hotel.
John R W,I made the reservation at the last minute and was surprised that the rate was so reasonable.  I was also given an upgrade to the executive floor that has a very nice view of the airport. The hotel is also very quite.  The only negative is that there is no gift store.  Very much appreaciated.
Anthony C,"After a long flight this is the place for me. Room  was clean and cozy, staff very friendly and  accommodating, food just perfect for  me. Will stay again when in Cebu. Close and convenient to the airport was a plus for me."
