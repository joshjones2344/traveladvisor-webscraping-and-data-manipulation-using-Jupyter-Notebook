Secret,"All staffs provided better services which made me feel comfortable and happy. Particularly, one male concierge was excellent. I remember his name, DOLF, I would like to comment how I pleased was with the service given by him. He is the best concierge ever. I really made my day thanks to him. Many thanks."
Michael J,"It used to be good but since Covid it has gone downhill. The rooms are getting tired, the lobby needs work, the staff need better training and it needs new management and an investment. Last time I stayed I had a cold shower for 5 days straight even though every day I was told it had been fixed. Management is obviously very poor and this shows. I have stayed there 12 times but never again."
Czar Emmanuel,"While this remains as one of the well-known hotels in Cebu City, particularly in Lahug area, it is clearly old and needs renovation. The ground floor is okay, with very few but nice shops and restaurants, but the upper floors, especially the rooms, show clear signs of deterioration. The carpets were stained, some furniture's upholstery was also old, the headboard of my bed had some torn canvass, some parts of the lampshade were peeling off, etc. WIFI was also weak, and the conference rooms were not soundproof. We had a three-day function in one of the conference rooms on the second floor and we could hear all the noises coming from the other conference rooms. The swimming pool and the gym were small. The elevators were very slow. Lastly, the menu of the restaurant near the lobby"
Rodel of Betterman Tours Bohol,"Approachable Front officers, big parking, huge massive lobby, Hotel location is at its best. Near and even walking distance to IT park where you can find more dining places. Not far from Malls. Nice to held and event with big function halls and breakfast is a must."
LKJE,"We stayed here for the for the first time four years ago and I loved it. This time we used it as a base in cebu  for a 4 week tour. It fell short unfortunately. It is looking a little tired  now, the pool area has a derelict waterfall that is taped off, the rooms are hit and miss in quality too. One night we stayed in 1411  and it wasn't until we were on our way to Danao port my wife said I was bitten all night by something, were you?. Er, no!!. And if I was I wouldn't have stayed in the bed. I'm not saying there were bed bugs in our bed but only when she sprayed her legs in 50% deet did it stop. Final day we stayed we didn't get a room until 16.15 having arrived from the camotes island at 13.00. Shame as I really liked this place. The only people getting booked in were ones for"
WombatAussie,"We regularly stay here because of the great price, service, and fantastic breakfast. But we can highly recommend the buffet dinner too. We had a small complaint that there were none of their fantastic muffins for breakfast and to our surprise we found a box of muffins was delivered to our room -  this says that they know that ""little things can mean a lot""."
Nathalie N,"Not impressed with this hotel. Would not return. I did a last minute, literally booked this the day before, trip to Cebu. Not much hotel availability anymore at that time so I picked this one. I figured a 4 star rated hotel with a casino and nice pics should be nice. I was not a fan of this hotel, and I don’t need much fancy at all. Upon arrival, the lobby is huge and looks nice, but it was smelly. It was very clean but the smell didn’t want me stay in the area at all.  The room was just ok. The bed wasn’t very comfortable, but ok.  The bathroom appliances were old and my shower pull bottom from switching from bath tub mode to shower mode was stuck so I only got have the water shower. I didn’t bother asking for new room or getting this fixed. I made due.  Casino was boring. Lots"
RaSha,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in May 2023. It was a good stay. Rooms are reasonable in size for a four star hotel. Buffet breakfast was OK , the choices average. Staff were polite and helpful. Centrally located. I would be happy to recommend this hoel."
Rinku P,"Stayed in for 1 night. They don’t live up to their brand.  - Checkin experience was average. They had only 3 desks open for checkin. Resulting in people standing in queue for more than 15mins.  - Pool area definitely needs maintenance. Broken chairs, chipped tiles, slippery areas.  - Bar at the pool - Don’t come with any expectations. Only selective beer available. No cocktails or wine by the pool.  - Drinks inside the hotel - strictly ok. Again very few options.  - Restaurants- they have several restaurants serving different cuisines like Italian, Japanese, Chinese etc. Being a vegetarian (no meat no fish) we wanted buffet option. There was nothing that we could use except bread. So we ended up eating Italian. Quality not upto mark with price and hotel name. Breakfast buffet"
Claudia D,"The shower was third world, dated and dirty room. I booked the wrong waterfront hotel. I meant to book the one across from the airport and booked downtown instead, try to change booking, spoke to a very rude registration person called Leti asked for manager she said manager was on vacation. The place is pricey and a hell hole"
Jonathan,"We recently spent three nights at the Waterfront while conducting some business at the US Consulate located downstairs.  Despite the limitations imposed by the pandemic,  we found the food and staff service to be first rate. They are striving to provide a guest experience that is as stress free as possible under all the circumstances.  I salute the staff and management for their excellence!"

Time and time again, every time I gaze at the structure of this hotel from the City's thoroughfare, it reminded me of the famous Disneyland Castle and it made me smile by"
charl0ttestuck,Air conditioning was a problem which made us move rooms several times. Placement of curtains in the shower was not well thought of because water would still soak the bathroom floor even if the curtain was properly closed. I would call room service or housekeeping and even operator several times and they wouldnt pick up.
tundagkent19,"Food was very good and we will always come back for that. The managaer was very generous to upgrade our room since the aircon was not functioning well. But, the pool attendant was kinda rude and some food servers are kinda unattentive. But overall it was very good."
j0celynbustamante,"Any business or establishments defined on their excellent customer service. Customers are loyal because the best experienced they received, and I am one of those customers. The values and the frontline team members made the Waterfront the best place to stay in Cebu."
Coachjugz,I love the fact that the hotel and the staff is vmchild friendly. I didnt even have to ask for a bowl of cereal for my child. The room is big and spacious and clean. I would love to come back for another staycation with my family one day.
mysteriousdebz,"This was just an overnight staycation... Staff was accommodating and breakfast was good! however, wifi and tv cable were intermittent... other than that, everything was good. i highly recommend this hotel..."
Rhonareta,"I rate it excellent because the services were all good. From security, front desk, food and etc. If given a chance to recommend a hotel to anyone who like to travel. I would gladly recommend this hotel."
jeancoke21,awesome and very convenient place to stay in... due to pandemic they don’t have buffet so they serve breakfast set at a very low cost and love their American style meal set. Recommended place to stay in the city.
jaysontipontipon,"Room reservations, amenities, and all are EXCELLENT. My stay in Waterfront was very worthwhile and noteworthy. If I will be given the chance to choose a hotel to stay in the future, I will always choose Waterfront. But there's one thing that I weren't that satisfied, there was this one young lady who was one of those who serve our snacks that was so moody when serving. Other than that, everything is excellent. Thank you for the accomodation, Waterfront, Lahud Branch!"
Perry B,We had a good time at this establishment and found it comfortable and well serviced. The staff were very pleasant. The swimming pool was the perfect place to retreat to amid the  mid autumn warm weather last year. It was a particularly good one!
Daphne,"Due to the Pandemic our company let us stay here for a couple of days to prevent us from getting infected since i live far from my office. All of their staff has a pleasing personality.. From the gardener, security, receptionist, buffet area..and even their chefs..  amidst the crisis, you can still see them smiling and addresses your concern in a pleasant way..   Thank you for your service..."
Persephone,"For so many reasons... Room rate P5k 1 No bidet - reported on the first day. I was told that all standard rooms don’t have bidet. Guess what? My friend is in a standard room with bidet. I was then told that not all rooms have bidet. Yung totoo? 2 Slowest internet connection any time of the day or night. 7mbps download, 2mbps upload. I started watching an hour film around 1AM. I’m still on 00:53 at 4:53AM. Lol 3 AC issues - also reported on the first day and we’re already on our 10th day. I did multiple follow-ups but they simply don’t care.  4 Power plugs and or sockets are far from where it should be. Don’t expect to use your phones while lying down and charging. Or bring your own extension wires if you still want to check in here.  5 Food...insanely expensive, mediocre taste."
kwagatsuma1121,"i tried to book a 2nd night from your hotel internet sight directly, but it was impossible because of credit card authority. i could book from Expedia by same card. i think there is some trouble in your sight."
marvinbernardino2020,Your hotel is highly recommended to other persons/travelers who want to stay and experience the beauty of CEBU. Thank you for the good service and Delicious foods (Breakfast Buffet). Have a Blessed Sunday Morning :)
Glicel Ann P,"The staff is very friendly, helpful and professional. In the heart of Cebu city and near IT Park, this is a lovely hotel. I love the colonial feel to it. The room are spacious with good facilities. The hotel has a lot of places to eat. I will never forget that i saw one of the most famous artist in ABS-CBN, Ian veneracion, Vina Morales and Morissette. I was so happy that time. And now i know that this hotel has a lot of artist to go there."
Ronnel C,"Great atmosphere, several nice onsite restaurants to choose from, good breakfast buffet no matter where your from they have something for you. Rooms were very nice, I had the executive suite. Hotel staff was very helpful. Almost everything you need in one place. Close to the Ayala mall, and the in hotel stores were nice as well."
Roel,"From Mactan Cebu International Airport, tell the taxi driver to drop you off at Waterfront Cebu City Hotel and Casino in Lahug , about a 35-minute drive and conveniently located across Cebu’s IT Hub, the Asiatown IT Park. The hotel is also just ten minutes away from the premier shopping malls and hottest lifestyle destinations.  The waterfront hotel is very comfortable and also the employees is approachable and kind. Soon I’ll be back here."
Farrah G,We were there just for an overnight layover. We are very pleased as we were upgraded to the Ambassador Suite for free. Amenities are a bit dated but still very clean. We were hoping to use the pool but it was a bit crowded that time of year.
Adam S,"Some good (if pricey) restaurants to choose from with good food. The lobby looks great and the ambient music from live performers is a nice touch, though the saxophonists especially were pretty pitchy.   Some general requests which were outside the norm resulted in some quite intensive questioning by the staff (for instance my wife just wanted a slice of bread without anything on it, and iii took a good 5 minutes for the staff to understand this) and the staff weren't particularly attentive in the lobby lounge, but in general the place was fine.   It's not particularly close to anything except IT Park, be prepared for a lot of traffic to and from the airport."
