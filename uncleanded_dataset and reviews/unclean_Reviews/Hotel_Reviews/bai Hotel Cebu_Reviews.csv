Angel C,"The concierge greeted us with a smile before we went inside. The servers Dwayne, Roxanne and Venz were very friendly, efficient and even offered us their best seller drink(which was very good indeed). The food was great and very delicious, thanks to the Chefs Fiona, Jake, Moanah and Jose. Will definitely be back to order the Ribeye steak! :)"

Jay M,"Friendly Staff.  Fast service during breakfast.  The room is clean with very reliable wifi.  Great view from the roof deck.  Breakfast is good, nice spread of western and asian. Nice taho idea wherein a staff is dress as a taho vendor and going around the floor and offering it to the guest."
Alfie E,The room is really nice and comfy. Even in hallways it smells good and very clean. The staffs are very accomodating. They even call me to check if the room is to my liking. I will definitely choose Bai hotel in my next visit here in Cebu. Thank you for warm welcome Ms. Marjurie.

Edwin T,"Very good food & service! Most especially to d nice hospitality & assistance of Erick! Will again come back and also recommend to others.  Had just some minor observations like: slippery floor at Japanese Station, not so customer-oriented server of roasted beef counter slicer at Western Station (needs more training on customer service)."

slowtraveler987,"This time I tried bai hotel. A hotel in city Centre. it was central but nothing around. The hotel. Say it‚Äôs a 5*, the people and hospitality is just fantastic . Breakfast is a 3 but easy to improve. Room is 4, housekeeping a 5+, aircon is just noise a 2. I‚Äôm a fruit lover. Here that was a disappointment. And please don‚Äôt start the answer with don‚Äôt have when asking about something in breakfast. Improvement more fresh juice station. Better fruit station include cebu famous fruit MANGO. For coffee better quality, a barista?  And at last not everything need to be sweetened  Forgot to tell: waffles and pancakes was awesome fantastic. Best in Asia that I have teased."
