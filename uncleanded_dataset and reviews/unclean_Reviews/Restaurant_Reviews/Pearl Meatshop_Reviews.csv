SimplyJonique,"This review is for the branch in Mactan, Lapu Lapu City and doesnt reflect their other branches. When we ate there with my family early/mid 2016, we hoped it would be better than the other korean restaurants weve dined in but shocker. It turned out..."
Kriix B,"Korean food is delicious and we all know it. And if you're one of the heavy food lovers, you'd be quite disappointed of their serving size. The food here is good but you'd be paying a lot for a good size of food - especially..."
Aleckzandra0122,This resto has been recommended by one of my friends and being at the center of the city is very much accessible and easy to go to. Although this place does not have airconditioning it is situated in a cozy area where you can relax...

c0ntinentalh0pper,"It was 1.30pm when we arrived & only 2 other tables were occupied, both in the middle of dining but no server attended to us though we stepped close to the counter.  The menu says something like minimum of 2 orders but the waitress wanted..."
LuluShad0w,"I love kimchi! I wont feel guilty eating all the salad, kimchi with 180g meat without the rice. Price is reasonable. The place is stuffy. They need to improve the ventilation."
Third C,"Just a normal restaurant with not so flavorful Korean dishes. I wasn't too impressed plus the place is hot and no proper ventilation. Their staff are nice though. If you are on a budget, this isn't the right place for you."
jinch0i,"Been here for a while now, its the first Korean restaurant that I've like, since it wasn't noisy and its very clean aside from the other Korean restaurant that I have visited. Their first branch was in Mandaue, the second was in the strip Capitol,..."
mykymo,"I've been coming to pearl for years now, but have just gotten around to writing a visit. I love this place. The price for the meat is pretty darn reasonable, plus you get a bunch of side dishes. Its a great meat grilling place. Caveat..."
Mark Emmanuel Y,"Ordering is easy. Each head is required to order 1 serving of meat, of which prices ranges from P180 to some P250+ per serving. So if there are 4 of you dining, you need to order 4 servings of meat. It could be of the..."
mikaelau,"Great Korean food at a lesser price. They also give free salad and soup. It is a small place, not very noticeable from the highway but definitely a must-try!"
Anjunette C,"Not really tasty, but me and my friends had a great time cooking the pork and beefs. So gonna rate it for 3 stars. Always packed with people i think"
John Philip P,"This is a Korean restaurant.  

Their best seller is Samgyeopsal, which they sell for Php 180 per serving.  

What I like is the fact that the side dishes are unlimited and they also taste good! 

Service is good as their staff attends to the immediate..."
