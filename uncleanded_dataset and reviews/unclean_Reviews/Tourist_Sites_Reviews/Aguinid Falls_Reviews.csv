ckwong,I really would not have gone to the Falls if I had known I would have to climb up 8 levels of waterfalls by clutching the walls like spider man with the water cascading downwards with no option of stopping once the climb begins at the 1st level. I am 75 years old and my wife 68 years. There is no harness to hold you back shd you topple backwards. Only one guide to pull you up and one below you push u up. But one cannot stop because climbing downwards is impossible. you just have to keep climbing up. There are small grooves chiselled into the wall for your hand and feet to clutch or step in. I was praying like crazy for God to lift me up. Just keep climbing to get to the top and get out. Praying very hard for my wife too because she is not into sports at all. But we made it to the 8th level. I  must say it was dangerous looking back but some sort of achievement having done it .It was exhilarating but frightening. A once in a lifetime experience. Excellent xperience because we made it alive. But I wont do it again.
Bob W,Had an amazing time climbing these waterfalls with the guides.  The guides were conscientious and made sure we were safe and having fun.  The waterfalls were beautiful and the pools were so refreshing!  We surprised ourselves reaching the 8th level with their help as we are both in our late 50’s and only moderately active (but we love adventures!!).  Highly recommend this activity
Bee A,"Highly recommend. Thrill seekers will love it but not just that, I’m the biggest coward yet I loved it. Please do it. It’s scary but honestly so fun."
Paula V,"It's not as touristy as other waterfalls for sure but for an introverted office worker like me, the Aguinid Falls course is just right. I loved being among the quiet lush greenery. I'm always in the city so to see greenery instead of buildings and cars was very refreshing. Initially, I was a bit apprehensive because it does not look very impressive in the photos, but surprisingly I had a very good time! The course was a little bit hard for a weakling like me (I really do not get enough exercise) but not hard enough to make me want to quit halfway. The guides are very friendly and helpful. They don't demand you to tip but my friends and i gave my guides 400 pesos each.. thank you for ensuring our safety. I don't go out a lot so I was a little scared about the course. They always helped me when I needed help in carrying my weight.Thank you csp for the ride there.. we appreciate the free towels (I forgot to bring my own) and also the go pros because we don't have any of those at home. Next time, I will bring my own waterproof bag.. my phone almost got wet."
Bb Josephine,"Went for a quick visit here and it was truly the highlight of our Day!  There is an Entrance Fee of Php 300 per Persons (inclusive of Entrance Fee, Environmental Fees, Guide Fees and Safety Gears (shoes and helmet) and I think it was worth the price. The falls was until 8th Level and I can say each level was a true combination of adventure and beauty. Our Guides (Kuya Mark and Ate Cora) were very friendly and supportive."
Cesar G,"This is our second time to visit Aguinid falls. After swimming with the whale sharks, we went to the falls. First we had lunch at the entrance site where they cooked our meal. It was delicious! P1,200 for 4 main dishes with rice and coconut water. There were leftovers in our group of 5.Compared to last year(Jan. 2019), the entrance fee jumped from P60 to 300. There was no required guide last year and no shoes and helmet. Appreciated the shoes as the rocks can be slippery and the ground uneven. This time, there are 8 levels compared to 5 last year. Our guide Andrew is very friendly and helpful. The place itself is still beautiful. But there is less water and some areas are without water. Last year, the water current and the falls were spectacular! Was told there was drought all year? Enjoyed the rock climbing part with and w/o rope. I thought it was more fun last year. Maybe it was because it was our first time?"
Gusts L,"It was very beautiful. After diving and visiting cities it was a breath of fresh air. You will have to guides assigned to you. We were 4 persons, me my wife and our two children. 16 and 13 years old. We were able to climb all the levels of the waterfall. Price was 300 pesos per person. Plus after we gave100 pesos tip to the guide. Both guides help you to get up at more technical places."
Neal O,"We went as a couple and had an amazing adventure here. The pair of us were new to waterfalls and the falls were just perfect for non-climbers. A real adventure. What we would have done without are two excellent guides I don’t know, Carlos and his cousin lead us with expert and got this 61 year old and partner up the 8 levels with great care.Thoroughly recommended for the adventurous first timer. A waterproof camera would be a good extra as the scenery here is breathtaking."
Annakristin147,Highly recommend- the guides are very helpful and it was an amazing experience. There are 9 levels you can pass and each is unique and refreshing. The guides take amazing pictures of you and help you to bring your bags safe and dry to the other side. So far best experience for waterfalls
Len,"Completely disorganized operation, and blame can lie with the employees who work here, and I assume their government superiors.  Rude to customers, did not provide adequate information on the falls.   Way over priced for what you get.  I would not recommend as there are far better waterfalls to visit in the area."
