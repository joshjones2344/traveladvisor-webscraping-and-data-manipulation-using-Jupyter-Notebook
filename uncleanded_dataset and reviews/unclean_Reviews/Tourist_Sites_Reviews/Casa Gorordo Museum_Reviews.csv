mama a,This one of my favorite place in Cebu that I've visited this yearThe experience on how old days place And it's an historical place
Rojo Tapiador,"One of the best museum experiences I've had so far. What set it apart was the tablet they will lend you (in my case I was reminded by the guard to get one since I'm halfway already when they noticed I don't have one) which serves as your personal tour guide which is played by one of the residents (reenactment) of the old house.vThe ground floor is air-conditioned and was okay. But going up the 2nd floor, you will get to experience what the early Cebuanos (the rich ones at least) experienced during their time. No Air-conditioning but lots of windows and ways to cool down. I really felt like I was taken back in time every room I enter while playing the appropriate voice and video caption per area of the house. The narration and stories really get me connected to the house as I take every step to every corner. Lastly, my enjoyable visit would not be possible if not for the kind and professional staffs, specially kuya Guard. Will definitely come back here withy family."
Meg Edelveiss D,"Aside from the fact that the place was very aesthetic, the interior as well as the structure of this museum will make anyone awestruck."
Francis Demetri A,"Casa Gorordo Museum in Cebu City is a captivating journey into the region's cultural heritage. The well-preserved colonial house, immersive exhibits, and knowledgeable staff create an exceptional experience. The museum offers a glimpse into the Gorordo family's life through authentic artifacts and personal belongings. It's a must-visit gem that showcases the rich history of the Philippines with passion and authenticity. The staff at Casa Gorordo Museum are incredibly passionate and well-informed. They are more than happy to answer any questions and share intriguing anecdotes about the house and its history. Their dedication to preserving and promoting local heritage is commendable and adds a layer of authenticity to the overall experience."
Vinabel Felisilda,"One of the living historical sites that maintain Cebu's rich history, culture, and tradition is the Casa Gorordo Museum. The two-story house's construction with stone blocks, hardwood flooring, and treasures inside greatly astounded me. Every time I see those beautiful pieces on exhibit, it takes me on a fascinating voyage through time. With that, I can say, it is truly an art!"
Meg Edelveiss D,The place spoke volumes of Cebu's heritage and it was nostalgic roaming all over the place. The staff were also very accommodating and there were also some amazing performances of arnis and some Philippine dances as well.
Agnes G,"Entering the building felt like we time travelled to hundreds of years ago. The building design wasn't the only thing that was old-fashioned, but also the furniture inside. Equipment used by the country during the old times were displayed, and it was very fascinating to see."
Stella B,"Casa Gorordo is a museum located at the heart of Cebu City. We visited the museum during our Gabii sa Kabilin event. There were a lot of people in the museum and yet, the staff handled the crowd professionally as there were lines and a clear area on where to enter and exit the museum. The museum was full of wonderful artifacts, from history to religion, and we really had a great time there. The balcony of the museum feels like we’re living in the past, just like the women in the past waiting for their lovers to make harana. There was also a Bo’s coffee where people could sit and have a good time after visiting. Balik batik was also there and we got to try on filipinianas and take great pictures. All in all, it is indeed a must visit when touring in Cebu City."
Hans Y,To experience going to a museum in casa corordo made feel like going back to the past and learning more about them.
Kiar,"The place was beautiful and interesting. I haven't really gone to musuems in Cebu, so this was a great first stop. The artifacts were well preserved and I particularly liked the different dishware and cooking pots. My only problem was the place was really really crowded, but this was more so our problem than the museums. Once we stepped out on to the garden however, the air felt great and the food stalls were tasty. Would definitely go here again."
Sydney G,"We weren't able to completely appreciate and explore the museum because there were so many people, but despite the limited time, we were equally as impressed with the artworks. One of the must-see displays was a glow-in-the-dark artwork. In addition, the museum itself was a work of art. The museum's architecture and design could transport you to another period!"
Alexis T,"Upon entering the museum, I was immediately struck by the sense of history that enveloped the space. The well-preserved architecture, ornate furniture, and meticulous attention to detail created an authentic atmosphere that effortlessly transported me to a bygone era. The knowledgeable and passionate staff members were eager to share the stories behind each item, further enriching my understanding of the family's lineage and the significance of the artifacts on display. The museum's commitment to authenticity and preservation was evident throughout. The family's personal belongings, photographs, and letters were carefully curated, providing a personal connection to the past. It was truly remarkable to witness how the museum seamlessly blended historical significance with intimate family stories, creating a profound sense of connection and empathy with the people who once called this house their home."
Faith S,"The house was perfectly preserve, leading us into being more intruiged compared to the other exhibitions. So much history, as well as mystery lies within each step along with the fascinating introduction of Filipino culture reflected through the statues located at the first floor. The paintings and in inheritance, even with the simpliest notebook, showed presence of life and privilege in the past. Not to mention the cafe at the end of the tour being a perfect cherry on top as it helped us rest and encapsulate the beauty of such Casa."
Nev Leanne Apolonio,"My experience at Casa Gorordo during the Gabii sa Kabilin event in Cebu was truly unforgettable. The historic ambiance of Casa Gorordo perfectly complemented the evening's cultural festivities. The interactive exhibits and guided tours provided fascinating insights into the rich heritage and traditions of Cebu. The tour transported me back in time and left me with a deep appreciation for Cebuano culture. Overall, Gabii sa Kabilin at Casa Gorordo was a captivating and enlightening experience that I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Cebu."
