alwaystravelsf,"Someone recommended seeing this Monument and Yap house a stones throw away.  Great place to start sightseeing of area.  Didn’t do any research previously,  but was fascinated by the size and the characters depicted.  They look like bad ass Warriors and I was the only one there .  Only about 5 minutes to look at and then make your way to Yap house!"
Yann,"The Cebu Heritage Monument is impressive and offers a rich insight into the history and culture of Cebu. The intricate sculptures beautifully depict key events and personalities in Cebu's past. The monument's location in the heart of the city makes it easily accessible for visitors. However, it can get crowded at times, limiting the opportunity for a peaceful and immersive experience. Nonetheless, it remains a must-visit attraction for anyone interested in Cebu's heritage."
loo c,"The Cebu Heritage Monument is a stunning sculpture and a must-see attraction in Cebu City. The monument depicts important historical events and figures in the city's history, from the arrival of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan to the Battle of Mactan. The intricate details of the sculpture and the use of lighting make it a beautiful sight to behold at night. The monument also features a fountain and a small park, providing a relaxing and picturesque spot for visitors. The monument's location in the city center makes it easily accessible and a perfect addition to any itinerary exploring the city's rich history and culture."
Czar Emmanuel,"This monument depicts important scenes from Philippine history, particularly with reference to the Christianization of the country. It is located in the Parian district of Cebu City (right across the famous Yap-Sandiego ancestral house), specifically in a plaza of an old church that has been demolished and now a fire station stands in it. The monument is quite imposing. However, some pieces of it are beginning to crumble. I wish the local government would do something about it."
uzmelissa,"This monument tells us very detailed information about Cebu history and Magellan's factor. A great architecture and amazing point, it deserves taking some pic tures with it."
Oscardog16,"Free to enter, not crowdered and well worth a look.  Don't need a guide if you have read a small amount of the Cebu history.  It is within walking distance of most tourist sites in old Cebu."
Reslimpan,"Very interesting monument depicting Cebu’s history from Magellan’s arrival, I am sure they had a history before that but no sign of that. That doesn’t make the artwork less interesting, beautiful statues, impressive work. All the information about the monument is no longer there, thus having a guide is helpful. Outside of the monument some touts pushing pearls and other “jewelry”"
richj65,Nice place to start and get great photos of a interesting monument.  Otherwise there is nothing else to see at this location.
extravelagent,....only because it's at the end of Colon street and a bit out of the way. It's a cool monument but it's a bit of a hike down Colon street- and then ahve to walk back. If you in a car it's ok but to walk a bit too much.
Irish Mae,"The place is tidy and well maintained.  As per guide, the sculptures represent the important event or history of Cebu. It is right in front of yap ancestral house.Nothing much to say since we just stayed 10 minutes."
irenevff,"you will really take a second look if you happen to pass by this sculpture at the middle of a busy street. it has numerous figures that kinda depict cebu's rich history. one will see magellan's cross & galleon, lapu-lapu, sergio osmeña, san pedro calungsod & other historical images that represent cebu's past which made it the strongest city in the visayas.its worse feature is the spot it stands on. you might get hurt from passing motorists  if you attempt to scrutinize the monument much closer."

LolaGo1,"Located at the middle of a very busy street, this attraction is easy to locate. The sculptures depict the history of Cebu .Note that nearby is located another attraction called, 1730 Jesuit House."
NPLim,The monument is filled with Stone carvings that describe each events that took place from our rich past. You will be welcomed by a caretaker who is full of wits. You will enjoy hearing stories straight from him. My kids appreciated everything we listed to. No fees here needed to walk around. But you can also be generous to Tip the caretaker who is passionate about his story telling and not to discount his sincerity to make you understand how the past happened.
Faithalicious_x,This monument is only really worth seeing if you are already in the area - ie you are visiting either Yap Santiego or Casa Goroado. It really is just a large statue and isn’t worth travelling to for itself alone. At least it’s free!
Joshua Trimidal,"I must say that this monument is very breathtaking for me. It is a beautiful reminder of Philippine history. The original Philippine house is also nearby. About 20 meters from this monument. This monument is free and you can take pictures here. Beware of local kids who offer fake jewelry. Keep everything hidden. It often happens that they reach into pants pants. The Philippines is one of the most beautiful areas in the world, but all the more you have to take care of your safety. Use grab to move. You can pay by cash or by card. For more information, feel free to write."
ShekouJon,It’s like a story book of Philippine history.  Don’t forget to check out the ancestry home nearby. Very cool.
Kimdelro,"Took a cab from my hotel to Yap-Sandiego Ancestral house. The house was indeed very old but small. 2 storey house you will explore antique and some art works back in the day. Has a 50 pesos entrance fee and a tour guide will walk you through. After this you can head out to the monument just in front of it, which I must say was massive and impressive for me. Must see around 4pm so the photo lighting wjll be good. From here I walked to the Jesuit house just a block away. This is a much bigger house- again filled with antiquities and history. Has a 50 pesos entrance again with a tour guide. I enjoyed this better than the Yap-Sandiego ancestral house. From here you can walk to the Sto. Niño Church and Magellans Cross. Then last stop is the Fort San Pedro where you can rest with good breeze and sunset. All can be done in 3hrs steady pace."
Poor guide,"If you wanted to visit jesuit, yap ancestral and gorordo this is where you should go. google map it.. no need to hire a tour guide to see these places."
Adrian I,Nice but nothing special. It's enough 10 minutes to visit this monument. Be careful on the streets for the pick pockets
