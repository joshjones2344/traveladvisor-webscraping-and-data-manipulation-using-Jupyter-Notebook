YuppieLionheart,I didn't know that this church existed as I only know the basilica but during our tour this is included in our destination and was able to visit a heritage site in Cebu <3
uzmelissa,A great Cathedral if you want to see religious site architecture within few minutes you'll reach. Well-kept and clean church as much as they can do and still welcomes its guest at a great condition.
richj65,I'm not a religious person but was impressed by the workmanship of the craftsman. When you consider the severe weather that this building has been thru throughout the years. Worth a look.
Francis_Elvis_Verdin,Along the way going to Yap Sandiego Ancestral House we approach by this church its a quiet place and also nearby church by Sto. Nino Church. A good place for Pilgrimage.
LolaGo1,"Located near the Basilica, this was the second Catholic Church that I visited on a Sunday morning. I like its intricate facades, the bells. the flowering gardens and the statue of Jesus outside.Said my prayers, took some pictures before leaving it"
nigsandmary,"On the way only a block from the Basilica, a lot of fans on a hot day, beautiful architecture worth a visit ."
Diver Jack,"Very nice place to see the old history of Cebu!  There is a charge to get in, but very cheap to see the culture!"
bklynbubba,"Just as beautiful and moving as the basilica, do not pass up a visit to the cathedral, which is right near by. Also enjoy the market around both buildings. Architecture buffs will certainly have their curiosity tested. For the me connection between the Philippines and Mexico is more evident here than that between the Philippines and Spain."
Lani,"I was with my family and my mom reminisce the time she was still very young having a picture in the grotto. We did take one at the same spot just to compare, of course, she can't sit down like the original because there are railings already. We attended the Sunday mass and took many pictures to capture its glorious view. Don't miss it when you're visiting the basilica del sto. nino, it's just nearby."
guillermo,"One of the most beautiful churches in Cebu City that I have visited at the centre of the old city. The well maintained and clean cathedral shows historical past, blends with the historic community. Best way to place through cab or Grab. This is popular destination for local and foreign tourist and devotee."
