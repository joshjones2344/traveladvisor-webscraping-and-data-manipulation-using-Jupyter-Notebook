Maueee's Happy Feet,We had a really fun and memorable experience in Cebu Ocean Park. We got to see different species of sea creatures. Entertaining but as well educational. We also tried their Aquadining and it was really worth it the food was superb . Youâ€™ll ve entertained by divers feeding the sea creatures.
Mississippi Analytics,"While there might be some other parks out there that are a tad more impressive, that doesn't mean you shouldn't give Cebu Ocean Park a shot. It's still a pretty neat experience, especially if you're in the area and craving some marine magic. I mean, who can resist the allure of underwater tunnels and adorable sea creatures? So yeah, if you're up for a marine adventure and want to explore what Cebu Ocean Park has to offer, go for it! After all, every aquarium has its own unique charm, and you might just discover something that captures your heart."

kopitemz,"I had a wonderful dining experience at Cebu Ocean Park. It is a unique experience that allows you and your loved ones to dine in an underwater aquarium, surrounded by marine animals next to the park's largest tank, home to sharks, rays and other exotic fish, thus offering an immersive dining experience. The 7 course meal at AQUA dining is top notch. It features a variety of seafood dishes and land-based options. They were fresh and delicious, made with locally sourced ingredients.For the best seat in the house, I recommend you to book your reservation in advance."

JANINA MARIE ME... V,"2 of my friends were able to visit the park and i was finally able to visit ocean park as well. And i loved it, especially the bird show and oceanarium. The view was beautiful, my gallery and ig story were filled with beautiful pictures. The park has fun activities like snorkling and helmet diving i saw little children and adults enjoy them. They had cute merch in the gift shop as well. Cant wait to visit again."
Samantha C,Customer service was great as we are being greeted everytime thereâ€™s a staff on the way. The place was great and also the food from the restaurant and kiosk tasted good. Will definitely go back but with my family instead.
Kylle A,Great experience. We experienced their diverse underwater restaurant world inside it. It exceeds my expectations.
Florida_family_kids,It was a lot better than I expected. Very clean and maintain. It shows were interesting in the food was OK.  Small but worth a vist.
Tom S,"This was a very nice excursion.  The lemon iced tea was more orange but delicious.  Also, the chattering lorries stole the day.  Highly enjoyable."
Justine Mae R,"We went there to freedive on their tank. The whole activity was fun. The watwr is clear and the tank is neat. The marine animals are also well fed. We actually left our freediving belt and we were able to get it even around 10pm. The guards, staff, and the manager were nice to accomodate our concern even beyond their closing hours. We'll definitely go back to dive and to visit the whole park again!"
Alleonah Patric... C,"I usually see most of the sea animals here in my workplace but to come here is absolutely stunning! We tried feeding the lories and we had fun! We also tried the fish spa, it was ticklish but with great experience!"
Craig O,"Had a nice time there. A lot of things to see. Admission was a little high in my opinion. The bird show was cute. Got to see the fishes getting fed. One bad point I had was when I went and bought an ice tea. Container was filled with unfiltered ice. Ice was not the one with the hole in the middle. Anyone traveling to here knows what I am talking about.  Needless to say, I developed the runs for a few days. My bad. I knew better."
Czar Emmanuel,"If you're fond of sealife and the ocean, then this is one place you should never miss when you visit Cebu City. It has a good collection of sea creatures -- fish, sharks, stingrays, etc. -- plus other animals (like birds, snakes, and other reptiles). It also has a nice restaurant, a  footspa, a souvenir shop, and so forth. Once you enter, check out the schedule of some animal shows to make the most of your visit. Also be ready to take lots of instagrammable photos! :D"
