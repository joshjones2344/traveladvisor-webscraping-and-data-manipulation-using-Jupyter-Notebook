alwaystravelsf,"Started at Heritage Monument and Yap house and very short walk to Colon Street. Many locals and Hotel doorman said either don’t waste your time or watch out for Pickpockets. No problems with Pickpockets.  Put your phone and wallet in front pocket! I have to disagree if you want to see the daily life of local people.  The sights, smell, food stalls , cheap shopping for locals.  I didn’t even go into the department stores or buy anything other than a Turon from a vendor and a can of beer at 7-11.  Sure I could complain that it’s a waste of time but it’s also interesting to see all the locals going about there day.  It was hot AF, and my feet hurt, but the best thing was taking a white bus back to Cebu IT Park for 20 php, riding with locals and crazy bus driver.  This is why you visit new cities so you can mix in with the locals!!!  Just Do It!"
ybo7000,"Colon is the oldest  street in cebu. It is a very  busy street where shoppers n people converge. Many public transport routes usually passes by this street. The street is filled with many malls, groceries, shops, restaurants, bakeries, drugstores, universities etc. It's a budget friendly place for shoppers to eat  stroll n shop."
extravelagent,"Lots going on on this street; not for everyone. Even the hotel told me not to visit but of course since they said that I had to. Keep your backpack on your front. Lots of people, crowed, some sketchy folks but if you need anything, Colom street will have it. Would I go back? probably not."
irenevff,"colon - a jargon for the human intestines. but in cebu, it is a long street abuzz with people from all walks of life. oh yes, some are even caught jaywalking to reach the other mall across from the one they came. you can see a university along this avenue, banks, markets, schools, hotels, restaurants, commercial outlets, alleys leading to residential houses - everything. must be the busiest street in the entire city.there's even a little monument marking the end/start of the long road."
Zsofia S,Visited here last February and I love how people are busy looking. All of the stores are really cheap.
Francis_Elvis_Verdin,Colon Street is a historical street in downtown Cebu City that is often called the oldest and the shortest national road in the Philippines. It is named after Cristóbal Colón.
Mark D,"The oldest street in the Philippines they say.. some great deals if you know where to look, but, watch your self... go with a local..(dont stray alone). not a local that gets kickbacks from the shops.. maybe from the hotel, they probably have a city guide... fun, definitive Philippines shopping experience"
Jing d,This photo is just the perfect subject about situational awareness. I am using a local situation because I am from Cebu and my audience are predominantly Cebuanos.
jens,i never see such many sidewalk sellers and sometime they call me joe..what does mean? so funny and i just give smile back. . . .i stayed near here for this is the oldest street. .
LolaGo1,"It is a typical major street in any city in the Philippines. There are stores selling various types of merchandises, fast foods restaurants, public transports called, jeepneys, etc.."
