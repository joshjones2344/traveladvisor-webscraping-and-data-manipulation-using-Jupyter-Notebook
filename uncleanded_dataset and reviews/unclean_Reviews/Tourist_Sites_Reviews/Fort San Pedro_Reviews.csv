burghughes,"This was my fourth time here and I always enjoy it. It’s a beautiful place for an afternoon walk. Even though it was hot while we were there , there is plenty of shade to be foundWe had a volunteer tour guide for part of our visit this time. He was filled with information, but delivery was pretty boring and he spent way to long in each section, so after a while I tipped him 300 pesos and we explored on our own. Where the tour guide is really helpful is in the galleries to explain the art pieces, after that I suggest type and go on your own."
Rojo Tapiador,"The tour was nice. Entrance Fee: 30 Pesos (Price same for locals and foreigners)It's not as big as intramuros but the ambiance of the colonial era can still be felt. Some locals we're doing photo shoots for debuts. Lots of tourists but the line was not long because a single person can buy the ticket for the group. Overall, happy but not sure if coming back again."
PJB,Visited today30 peso entrance feeWell kept compared to fort Santiago  but smaller however still very impressiveHad a wonderful time soaking it all up
RanjitM,"The fort itself is quite compact. a nice walk around which would not be for more than half hour. Ask for the guide, who're usually tourism students that are interning. They shall provide a nice historical background to each element of the Fort, as well a history into the Spanish entry into Cebu.They even have a cannon from one of Magellan's original ship ( i think / or from the first war in the 15th Century)"
Simon C,I enjoyed my visit around this ancient fort which is very solidly constructed – some of the walls are well over a metre thick and you can easily visualise how effective a stronghold this was.  There is a tiny entrance fee (20 peso).  A little more information about its heritage and day to day operations would have been very informative.
alwaystravelsf,Pretty cool to see but not that exciting for me.  History buffs might appreciate it more but I didn’t get that excited and it was Hot AF.  Small entrance fee comes with tour guide but I was kinda in a hurry so possibly why I didn’t enjoy it so much.
Ishi Lavador,It was nice to get a glimpse of Cebu's colonial past. The architecture was well-preserved and they even have the canons there. It's surreal that its the oldest fort in the Philippines and it's still around til today. Definitely worth the visit and would definitely go again! :)
Francis Demetri A,"Fort San Pedro in Cebu City offers a captivating glimpse into the city's colonial past. With its well-preserved architecture, informative exhibits, and panoramic views, this historic fort is a must-visit for history enthusiasts. While relatively small in size, it makes up for it with its rich heritage and picturesque surroundings."
Agnes G,We were welcomed by a drum ensemble upon entrance; it felt very grand. Inside were historical paintings that were very beautiful and fragile. There was also a den inside that served as shelter before; it was interesting and cool.
Meg Edelveiss D,The place spoke volumes of Cebu’s heritage. I enjoyed roaming the whole area as it was very nostalgic.
Meg Edelveiss D,The place spoke volumes of the heritage of Cebu. It was nostalgic to roam the whole place and watch the different performances of arnis and some Philippine dances.
Sydney G,"The architecture and structural design were admirable, especially with the military equipment still visible. Seeing the view (the harbor and islands) from a different angle made our visit to Fort San Pedro memorable. Together with the band and dancers, they created a nostalgic and lively atmosphere."
Stella B,"Fort San Pedro is a historical place located in Cebu City. We went there during our Gabii sa Kabilin event. Although I’ve been in Cebu many times and passed by there, I never got the chance to go inside the place. When my friends and I went there, we got to see old bikes, cannons, and we realized that the area has corals and some parts are made out of egg shells! There were also paintings of past events in Cebu city. It is a nice area to chill and learn about the history of Cebu City and the Philippines."
Anna Angelika S,The area is quite beautiful especially at night. We had a great time there. Our ride on the tartanilla was enjoyable as well.
Alyssa Magno,"The museum situated inside the fort's walls was definitely the highlight of the visit. Ancient weapons, ceramics, and works of art were among the remarkable array of objects on display in the exhibits. Each exhibit gave me a glimpse into Cebu's colorful past and advanced my understanding of the area's history and cultural traditions."
Francheska C,My visit to Fort San Pedro was truly memorable. The stunning architecture and ambiance created a delightful and captivating experience!
Samantha Nicole T,The place was very beautiful and interesting. My groupmates and I had a really great time when we visited a few days ago.
Neil Allen B,The place was beautiful at night and very interesting. There were some interesting classic bicycles and artifacts.
Kate,"I am amazed by the structural design of Fort San Pedro. It provided a glimpse into the  military defense structure before such as the cannons, watchtowers, and the prison."
Waldo Manalang,"Fort San Pedro is a historical gem in Cebu City, Philippines. Its well-preserved walls and structures take visitors on a journey to the Spanish colonial era. The fort's rich history and picturesque surroundings make it a must-visit destination especially with the numerous staff who cosplayed what soldiers in that time also looked like roaming the walls like the the Spanish colonial era."
