jason t,"Osme√±a Peak was a great place and have such amazing view I have Cool ride to this location, calming scene on the road as well. Fun and quick hiking. Additionally, the vista from the top is stunning. It is best to visit there right at sunrise or sunset to get the best images to remember the experience."
Danielle,"At 1013 metres above sea level, it stands as the highest point on the island of Cebu. Osme√±a Peak is a great beginners level hike. In around 15 minutes you would already have reached the top of the peak. Despite being the highest peak, it‚Äôs not that steep at all and is an easy, beautiful hike. The area has been nicknamed ‚ÄòLittle Baguio‚Äô for its cooler climate and abundant cabbage and lettuce farms. Despite climbing and arriving in gloomy weather, the fog cleared up just minutes before we were about to leave. Exposing the peculiar picturesque landscape of the pointy chocolate hills which we used to our advantage and took thousands of photos immediately. Try and time it so you‚Äôre there at sunrise or sunset and avoid wet weather. Kuya Joy, our guide, was such a good sport with taking all our instagrammable pictures and videos. He was like a human drone with all the instructions on how to pose and the video transitions. He also shared to us about how he learned about the peak and being a guide in only 9 years old. He trekked with professional mountaineers by then so they themselves gave him tips and tricks to climbing mountains which he was able to use as he became an official guide of the peak. Message me for his contact details if you‚Äôre looking for a trustworthy and helping guide. Not only that, we were accompanied by Billy. The cutest and sweetest dog, who the locals say was a tour guide in his past life. He climbed with us all the way up and down the peak, and simply rested while we were busy taking pictures. We were told that there used to be a group of girls who climbed and put up tents at the peak years ago, but because of the wind and rain their tent broke down, and because they did not have a guide that time, they were worried they wouldn‚Äôt be able to go down safely. Luckily, Billy was there. He was right outside their tent. They spoke to him as if he were human and he understood. Billy was able to lead the girls back to safety and that was just one of the many amazing stories about him.As you can see, visiting this place is more than just the beautiful peak itself. It‚Äôs the people, the community, the sweat and tears you may break, the reminder of how fragile our lives really are, how big the world is, and the experience.üè∑Ô∏è ‚Ç±50 per person, ‚Ç±100 for the required and hired guide. Guides are mandatory."
Chi_Tiff,"I will say this, if you‚Äôre going to go to Osme√±a Peak, go just before sunset and bring a small picnic or food with you so that you can stay and enjoy the sunset views. It‚Äôs a far drive and the way up is quite bumpy. The hike itself it only about 15-20 minutes and the guide I had was lovely!!  I‚Äôd definitely visit again, but this time I‚Äôd be prepared and make sure it was worth the long drive!!!"
Athena Gonzales,"I visited this place during the weekend to unwind. It only took me around 20 minutes to reach the peak, yet the fascinating view, along with the cool mountain breeze, paid off and made the hike way more rewarding than I expected. I had a great time relaxing given that the place wasn't that crowded. Ultimately, the best thing about the place was the locals. The local tour guides were astoundingly kind and hospitable."
KhanKluay,"After almost an hour bike ride from Badian, where we stayed, the bum hurts a bit. After parking the bikes road side, a steepish but not at all strenuous 30 min hike, climbing to the top, the views all over the island are more than rewarding. Many young and even older Filipino folks were climbing and hiking the peak, too, which is THE landmark of southern Cebu Island. It was an amazing experience, which I would do again and again, next time in Cebu. It is also a great activity for those who are based in Moalboal."
Taylor S,"Went here a year but the flashbacks of coming here again is enticing indeed. Chill ride coming here. Relaxing view along the way, too. Short and fun hiking. And the view on the top is simply breathtaking. Best to go there just in time for the Sunrise or Sunset to capture the perfect photos to treasure the experience."
Jakub H,"Way to Osmena for example from Moalboal (about 2 hours with motorbike). The hike is very short. I hiked up by 15 minutes, but i walked quite fast. If there is goof visibility you will have stunning view. If you want to climb it you have to pay fee, but this fee is ridiculous."
R0dent,"Sadly, on the day I visited, there was light rain and fog which obstructed the view.  But even with obstruction, there is breathtaking mountainous scenery that isn't usual for the Philippines.  The fog made it look like we were hiking up the Himalayas in a scene right out of National Geographic.To get to the trail head from Cebu City, you should take one of many buses from Cebu's South Bus Terminal to Dalaguete.  When alighting after a three hour ride, you can ask a motorcycle driver to take you to the trail head.  We were charged P200 per head for the 30 minute round trip bike ride.At the trail head, you will be solicited to rent a walking stick for P10.  You should definitely take it.  The hike up and down can be slippery and difficult as the trail is unpaved and poorly defined.  You'll be frequently navigating rocks at steep angles.  There is a high chance of falling without a walking stick if it's foggy or raining.At the trail head, it doesn't look like you can walk all the way to the peak.  But you can with the trail veering left behind some hills all the way up.  You'll just keep going until you reach the top which took us around 30 minutes.  Guides will be available for hire at the trail head for P150 who might be useful when taking photos.The view at sunset might be breathtaking, but the walk down can be treacherous after the sun sets.  In the valleys, it gets really dark really quick.  We had to use the flashlights in our phones.  Had the phones ran out of battery, it'd be near impossible to trek down.  Notice the area is sparsely developed which means no medical care if you need it."
Faithalicious_x,"We arrived for sunset on a cloudy day and even though we couldn't see to far the views of the surrounding mountains and the sunset that we could see was rather nice. The hike itself is pretty easy and straightforwards, it takes about 15-20 mins and could be done in flip flops if you really wanted to...we opted for trainers. Entry was 30 pesos, avoid getting a guide - they really aren't necessary at all. We mistakenly thought they were included as part of the ticket only to find at the end of the hike that he was expecting at least 150 pesos.The only drawback to visiting Osmena is how long the journey is from Moalboal. 90 minutes clinging on the back of a motorbike, over bumpy terrain, up and down hills, and around multiple bends was quite a lot to deal with (at least if you haven't been on a motorbike much). So it would be a personal decision as to whether climbing this peak is worth it, given the 3 hour motorbike travel time. In hindsight, I'm not sure that it is."
Anne.Shirako,"there are 2 ways to get there--hike UP for 3-5 hours through beautiful terrain and mountain farms and villages OR bus to within 1/2 hour of the peak and waltz to the top in flipflops. I recommend the hike--it's tough, but you can do it!"
Ladey,"Hardly a hike more of the lookout spot but beautiful view. It was maybe 15-20 min from the road which was paved the whole way. Sometimes the road if washed out so it can be a bumpy ride, especially for a motorbike. It is about an hour and a half from Moalboal. Google maps gets you there when you search osmena peak trailhead."
Miss Marie,"This is a really good location for watching sunset with your romantic partner. I got engaged here and became so memorable place to us. It was a long motorbike ride tho from our Moalboal (where we stayed at), I guess 2 hrs of motorbike ride. Got there at around 5pm, waited for the sunset. Didn‚Äôt expect it to be cold üòÖ So I was shivering, bring your jackets then. It is safe going up, just be careful about where you‚Äôre stepping on. There‚Äôs a building and staff at the foot/entrance of the peak."
mamaroche,"you can get to Osmena peak from Cebu City by riding buses bound to OSlob.  Tell the conductor to drop you off at Dalaguete juction.  There are 7-11 and Julie's bakeshop facing each other.  From there, there are habal habal with 200pesos fare roundtrip.  At around 25-minutes drive, you will arrive at the tourist's center and needs to pay 30pesos registration fee and a required guide fee of 300pesos.  Dont feel wasted with the 150pesos guide fee, let the community earn a living.  These guides will provide you better photos that you will keep forever."
Ashley Toh,"My friends and I began our hike up at 1+pm, after spending the morning at Kawasan Falls. We decided to get a guide to take us up, though we later realised that the guide was not entirely necessary -- there was a clear trail leading up, and for the most part the guide was ahead of us, just waiting for us to take photos and rest along the way. Don't expect the guide to share much information about the place; our guide mainly pointed out photo spots. The climb was moderately difficult, and challenging in having to figure out your footing on the way up and down. My friends (all of us in our 20s) were able to complete the hike in slippers. The sights at the top were definitely worth the trip, and our photos turned out wonderful since the sun was directly overhead :)"
itd-be-rude-not-to,"I took the bus from Oslob to Dalaguete and then a bike to Osmena Peak, its a 10-15 minute easy hike up and its worth the effort for the gorgeous views. Sunrise is the best time to visit."
Jon N,"We visited Osmena Peak last month while we were in Moalboal. We rented a motorcycle and ride from Moalboal, and took us almost 2 hours to reach here. The entrance fee is PHP30 each and from the entrance to the top of Osmena Peak took us less than 15 mins leisure walk. The view up at the peak is awesome, especially on a clear day."
pmtravel_10,Started the trip from Delegate - got habil habil (motorbike taxi - they hang out near the 7-11). Over 1/2 hr climb on the bike to get there. Osmena peak registration 60p. Got to top about 4.50 stayed their till 5.10 then habil habil (who waited) back to hotel paid him 500p.Osmena peak well worth the trip rough path up and lucky not to be cloudy so had pretty good sunset.
Patrick,"It‚Äôs my second time to trek Osme√±a Peak, and on my second visit, I had my first camping in the peak. When we reached our campsite, you‚Äôll instantly see the various 360-degree scenic view. You‚Äôll see the line where the sky and sea meets, the islands of Bohol and Negros, the cluster of hills, the different vegetation, all these and you‚Äôll also enjoy the fresh breeze of air. I suggest that you visit the peak before sundown and experience the breathtaking sight of the sunset from the highest peak in Cebu. loving the place."
WeiKeatSG,Went there in the morning before the noon sun is up. It is about a 15-20mins climb to the top. Great view! You have to pay a token entrance fee and it was mostly locals while i was there. Great place to relax and soak in nature
mikee,this is the first time i went to this place and it is very beautiful. staying overnight is nice too‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. ill be back here soon.
