tianrey126,"Arguably one of the best beaches in Bantayan Island. Also known as Sandira Beach. It is a bit secluded and there was a fee to enter. It was P60 but a signage advised it will increase to P80 starting April 01, 2023. Clear water and white sand. Perfect place to relax and be lazy. You can bring your own food and drinks but be sure to clean afterwards and dispose of your trash properly. A must visit when in Bantayan Island"
Steven S,"Google Maps showed 3.3kms from town so I decided to walk there for exercise passing The Ruins on the way. I followed Google Maps which directed me down a road off to the left and eventually to a local man who charged 25 pesos. I asked him what the charge is for. He said for the private beach. I told him there are no private beaches in the Philippines (unless it is at a privately owned island). Anyway, I paid the fee which was really for crossing private land. I ended up entering the water before the actual beach.Very nice beach, clean sand and clear water. There was some trash around off the beach. When I left the beach I found a parking area and a public dirt road that led me back to the main road. From the main road there is no sign pointing the way to this beach. Only a big sign with all the rules and regulations to visit the beach. This public road is about 500 metres further on from where Google Maps directs you. Of course the unscrupulous land owner is not honest enough to redirect you to the public road. I stopped two ladies on bicycles and redirected them to the public road. DO NOT follow Google Maps."
Mary jean Q,"This is as the name says, a Paradise Beach. It is the best beach on Bantayan Island; very clean, white powder sand, crystal clear water, great for snorkelling and swimming, also good for cliff jumping when tide is high, very quiet early on mornings for sunrise. It’s only 20 pesos entrance but this pays to keep it clean. It’s a bit hidden away from the busy Santa Fe but that’s why I like it. We also stay at Paradise Beach Guest House which is walking distance to this beach & highly recommend that resort! It’s a new resort, budget friendly, great food, all new facilities, good WiFi, peaceful and has great hosts! Highly recommend Paradise Beach & the Guest House. 5 ⭐️"
TengCorrea,"Located about 30 minutes from Sta Fe town, this is a secluded beach that has clear waters and gently sloping sandbed. Nothing much to do except just swim and laze around or explore the rocks nearby. (I'm letting the photos speak for themselves.)It's best to go in the morning as umbrella shades are on a first come, first served basis. There are no restaurants so you need to bring your own food and drinks.Entrance fee at 50 pesos. I got there via a habal-habal for 200 pesos roundtrip. I'm sure you can haggle or go there using your own ride."
Axel,This place is perfect for swimming..Clear and relaxing.I must say this is the highlight of bantayan trip if you love to swim under the sun
sergeyp7777,"Nothing special. I've seen better. Actually beaches in Santa Fe are better.It is far from Santa Fe, and they charge fee to enter this beach."
Srdan,A really amazing beach with crystal clear water and white sand. It wasn't crowded and we enjoyed it while our visit in February 2020. It is about 20 minutes tricycle ride from Santa Fe and for a return ride it will cost you around 300 PHP.
Francesc R,"Very nice small beach in the southwest of Bantayan Island.Good for chilling and sunbathing.Entrance fee (50 PHP/person).There aren’t amenitis, but you can buy something 200 meters before the entrance."
Paul C,We always enjoy having a picnic here during Amihan season when the beach is clear of seaweeds and the water so clean and clear. Few tourists
Harry O,Gorgeous serene beach.  A must see. No services so bring your own food and drinks.  No lounge chairs so bring a towel. Very safe for swimming.  Expect to pay 50 pesos entrance fee which is nothing really.  Taxi or motorbike will take you there and wait for you until you're ready to come back
Peter R,The white beach lies under black rocks and with its greenery and trees offers beautiful views. The water counts with lot's of seagrass and looks a bit greenish; still it is deep and nice to swim there and also snorcheling is possible.  To stay longer at the beach you need some protection as the sun hits down without mercy. The roads to the beach are in bad condition and you might need 45 minutes from Santa Fe to reach there. The visit of the beach costs entrance and there is no possibility to buy drinks or food. In my opinion the beach is still worth a visit but you should go well prepared.
Mel Brockhouse,"White sands, clear blue sea, not many people aboutIf you are looking for a slice of paradise then this is for you"
Paul V,"Given that there are not a huge number of things to do on nonetheless lovely Bantayan Island, it is worth a visit to Paradise Beach.  It is a lovely spot althoigh narrow at high tide.  There is nothing at all there except the beach.  We took a tuk tuk and bargained to 200 pesos to take us there for about an hour or so and then return to Santa Fe."
thedzki,"Entrance fee of 50Php and opens as per the signage outside 9-5PM. But I guess you can come as early as that (so I’ve heard). The place needs maintenance, and there’s not enough cottages to accommodate the crowd, so better bring your own shelter to keep you from being deep-fried under the sun! Although this beach is good for swimming and has a white sand (the only thing it differs from the other beaches), there’s nothing more to see from here. Just enjoy your stay far from the City."
Gorgeous S,"I’ve read in the internet that they open at 9am to 5pm. Had we known we should have gone there earlier while it was still not that hot. But one tricycle driver told us that they open as early as 6am. And so we went 8:30am but upon seeing the seaweeds washed off the shore, God the maintenance person there was raking them back to shore. God what a dumb! Guests are starting to come and how could they enjoy swimming if there are lots of seaweeds floating? Bakit di nlng idustpan at itapon sa mga bato sa taas diba? What a mindset. I dont know if utos ng may-ari or sadyang tinatamad lng kaya tapon nlng pabalik sa dagat? May entrance fee pa na P50. Jusko not worth it. Ayusin nyo muna cleanliness nyo bago kayo magpapasok turista. Nakakahiya."
wellred99,Lovely clear water which makes for great swimming. Some leaves had blown in the day we went but it didn't stop us getting in the water.Note this beach is not free to enter. You need to 1st pay a fee up top and then again on the beach. I don't understand why there are 2 fees for this. Don't forget to stop at the cliff drop steps for 'that picture'.
EarthyGirl24,"Visited here in the morning and in the afternoon. Everything is still nature. The staff in the entrance and the Guard assigned are friendly.I love the Beach a lot that when we went to the other resort we kinda compare it to the Paradise Beach/Sandira Beach and Went back after our Meals. And witnessed the lovely sunset.During low tide the beach isn't that pretty anymore but you can still enjoy the sandy beach and have a chitchat with your love ones. My 2 yr old son love it and played sand castle till sunset.I found out that Sandira Beach , Sta fe beach resort and Ogtong cave resort has the same owner.Hope it won't get commercialized as the days goes by...So while everything there is still on its nature. Visit now!"
MelbourneTravelmad,"This is a busy beach with several resort type places on or near the beach. The water was not the clearest, and perhaps the cleanest, around. There is limited shelter from the sun unless you're at one of the resorts. Sand was clean and typically coral based with small chunks of coral among the sand. An ok beach, but there are better."
Mjleon89,Nice clean and clear waters but there wasn’t a lot of amenities only a few nipa umbrella sheds. Good for a tan and swim for an hour or so.
Trancazia,"Paradise Beach or also known as Sandira Beach is pure unspoiled beauty off the beaten track a little but don't worry as most good Trike drivers will get you there, the entrance fee is about 50 PHP a short walk then your jaw will drop, definitely the place to chill, unwind, do some rock jumping or even swim this is the place.Would I return? Yes for sure and may even camp over.Who would enjoy this location?  All ages, if you have difficulties in walking there is a small drop down to the white sand, but nothing too drastic."
