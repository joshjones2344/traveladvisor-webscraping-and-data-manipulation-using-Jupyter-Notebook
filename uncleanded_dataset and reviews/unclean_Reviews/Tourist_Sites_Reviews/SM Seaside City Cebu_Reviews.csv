S Townsend,Itâ€™s a whole lot of nothing. Wide like a 6 lane motorway and plenty shops but nothing at all lol. Lots of eateries. But wouldnâ€™t go back. NZ malls are different and lots more in a smaller shop. Found walking around here was boring. May be huge but a whole lot of nothing. My daughter did go ice skating though
ybo7000,"The mall is huge n cozy. Lots of restaurants, shops, playgrounds for kids etc., mall has organized lots of activities to entice back more people to come to the mall. Its less crowded now compared  to pre pandemic  time. Its  a beautiful, clean and safe place to go to shop, relax and dine with friends and family."
Mark K,"We came here off the 3rd Mactan Cebu Bridge, so close, worth the experience to travel on such a nice bridge and be close to the mall.  This is like any other great SM mall, BUT... they have a skiing rink in a tropical country.  Not the best ice, or skates but worth the fun with my Pinoy niece and nephews.  Make sure to ask for Hockey Stakes, they are more like western skates."
Kozi Tsen,"Very big mall in Cebu with a circular floor plan. My main concern is the ATM and toilets. For the ATM, there was a time when ALL of the ATM was not available and no directions posted in the machines as to where else we can find another ATM available. As a result, we have to go around asking other people for help. No computer mall directory. The same with toilets, I don't know why they don't have toilet paper for the comfort of their customers. Sometimes they also run out of handsoap! This is one of the largest mall in the world and yet no toilet paper, no bidet, no handsoap!"
extravelagent,"Although one of the biggest within the top 10, I like it alot as it's manageable. Chess, archery, great eats, scooters, massage chairs, but most of all it was all walkable within reason! Best of all free a/c bus to Fuente Circle and SM Cebu.Like all other malls it has tons of shopping, cinemas and grocery store. But the free bus was waht I liked as it got me to the circle where my hotel was and totally left on time and was clean. Thumbs up!"
Ted C,"The mall is so large you will need a full day here, we visited twice in two days, plenty of variety and food outlets (avoid KFC the service is terrible,  Chow king chaotic but ok) the views from this mall alone, makes it worth a visit. Now that the third bridge is open its just a relaxed 15 minute drive to Cordova avoiding the mayhem of Cebu and Lapu Lapu traffic."
Irish Mae,"So far the best Mall in Cebu I have been. There are wide selections of restaurants, fast food, branded stores compared to Ayala.SM Seaside is very spacious, their rooftop is a must place to visit where you will feel the breeze of fresh air and sea view with mountain view."
Cathdee809,Mall is definitely huge!!! Easily get lost if it is first timeðŸ˜‚ Love the variety of shops and huge parking area below and it is for free!
irenevff,"been here again since 5 years ago and the place is still under expansion. when will it ever stop? there are still a lot of stalls that need to be occupied. funny seeing the skating rink almost empty at this time of the year. consequence of the pandemic.the cube at the facade (facing the ocean) is quite an attraction. biggest hollow cube i've seen so far. must be the counterpart of the sphere seen in SM MOA in pasay city, metro manila. would there be a 3D heart sculpture or a triangle spawning soon? SM can do it all, i guess."
Nico Samneil Sy Salado,Alot of spaces still needed to be leased. Convenience on transportation for people who would commute is not yet fully developed since there busses have a long interval. It is spacious and design is chic.
