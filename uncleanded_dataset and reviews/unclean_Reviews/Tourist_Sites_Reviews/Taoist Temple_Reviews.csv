Hieatsreych,"Visiting the Taoist Temple in Cebu was such an amazing experience. As soon as I arrived, I was immediately struck by the peaceful atmosphere and the stunning architecture.The prayer halls were serene, and I found myself taking a moment to reflect and connect with my spirituality. Lighting incense and making wishes felt incredibly meaningful and personal."
YuppieLionheart,"Free entrance with allotted parking space for visitors. You just have to make sure that your knees are prepared for their stairs, one of the visitors I saw as an elderly and they did not proceed because it's too high and they got tired in the middle so they let their young adults go to the temple on their own. I can say that it's worth it once you reach the top, you'll see a beautiful view and the architecture is really admiring but also please respect the rules as it's a place of worship. There's also an assigned police in the area when we went there."
Simon C,"This is worth a visit and a climb – its surprisingly steep. Its an impressive building and series of praying areas. Tourists are encouraged to visit but there is very little information about the temple or the religion, the only interaction is with the somewhat authorisation temple helpers holding up signs to ask you to wear a face mask (really?  - and its outdoors when its not legal requirement).   I would have welcomed an explanation of the “kidney beans”, which provides a yes, no, maybe answer to a question you pose, but at first sight, it does seem to be merely an example of probability theory rather than evidence of a higher being."
Chi_Tiff,"While I enjoyed my visit, you can see the entire thing in about ten minutes. I wasn’t allowed in the temple itself because I was wearing shorts and my shoulda were exposed, so if you want to enter this is something to be mindful of. It was alright but there are definitely better things to see/spend your money and time on."

richj65,A beautiful Oasis on top of the hill. Bring your walking shoes but there are plenty of places to rest. Once you get up top some of the best views that's views of the city.
Trond R,"Very nice place, but small place…you have seen it all in an hour.  There is a souvenir shop there also, so nice to have cash or card."
penasihatperjalanan,We drove up to the entrance today to find it's still closed due to that ongoing COVID-19v pandemic. You shouldn't bother coming up here until you're sure they're open again. The taxi drivers don't even know.
