justinejanejj,"The complex is massive. The temple is average sized, but the ceiling is high. It offers a good view of the city. Everything about this place is opulent. Can be a quick visit, since there’s not much to do."
burghughes,"The Temple of Leah is an impressive structure and a great place to take photos. Beyond that there really isn’t much to see/do here. We went earlier in the day, leaving central Cebu City about 9:30 AM. When we arrived it was not crowded, but when we left there was already a long line of cars to enter. There was a very talented singer in the lobby area and speakers carried his music throughout the site. Besides the view, that was probably what I enjoyed the most"
Mississippi Analytics,"That place is seriously something else. It's like someone took a chunk of ancient Greece and plopped it right in the Philippines. The grandeur is next-level, and the views? Total jaw-droppers. But, here comes the curveball – the trek up. If you're not exactly a fan of uphill hikes, well, brace yourself. The road to Temple of Leah is a bit like a mini workout session. I mean, the views are kind of the reward, but you might be huffing and puffing your way up there."
Cadie H,"It is a beautiful site. The inside is closed off, so only the outside to visit. Weekend price is 150 for adults. The cafe has nice desserts, there is a restaurant but we did not eat there"
YuppieLionheart,"It's my second time to go here. In 2022, you can't do a lot here, just admiring the view, take pictures and that's it. But this May 2023, when we visited the place, the first thing I noticed is their entrance fee increased but they give discounts to senior citizens and there's a restaurant inside so the visitors can now dine after striking a pose. It's an elegant restaurant so a perfect place to have a romantic date with special someone. The restroom hallways is also nice, you'll get a feel of luxury."
Simon C,"It’s a fine line between an example of conspicuous consumption and a mega display of wealth, or a magnificent work of art. As the owner said himself, “I cut off the top of the mountain” to build a palace inspired by the Parthenon in Greece in honour of his (still living) wife.  The building had plenty of marble and its makes for a good instagram picture, but really, what’s it for given it has four floors and about 12 rooms per floor, some of which are not quite finished and appear uninhabited.I understand that owner made his fortune in property and five years ago, the entrance fee was 50 peso, with seniors and children free.  Now it’s more than doubled to 120 peso for adults with a concessionary price for others. Not quite sure if this is to recover the cost or to pay the singer who adds ambience and character to what otherwise could be, unintentionally perhaps,  a shrine."
Chi_Tiff,"I absolutely love my experience here. I’m not sure if it happens all the time, but the day I went there was a violinist paying music there. It created a great vibe!! The views were spectacular and I arrived just before sunset. I’d definitely recommend this place. A guy took me on his motorbike for 500 pesos from the Taosist Temple, waited while I took my photos and hung out and then drove me back to my hostel!  Another driver tried to charge me 1500 for the same trip so definitely beware of being taken advantage of!"
Alleonah Patric... C,"The view and place is very nice, you can see that the husband who really adored his wife so much! However, the place is still under construction like the basement and the behind part.. the entrance fee is too expensive tho for only seeing the front and the view.. we wanted to see the things inside but it was locked up and we. An only see from outside through the window only. We do hope the next time we visit we can definitely come inside and see everything not just the statues and the view"
penelope j,"The temple was created by one of the richest husband in Cebu for his wife, obviously. From a far it was ominous, and you expected more. The place however, is not accessible for what it was advertising .It tells the story of a wife who was loving and loves to collect “nice stuff. All of these “nice stuff “ are all locked up. You will not be able to see it, you will be disappointed because you were charged an entrance fee, and you expected more."
Aurora_Nomad,"To be honest, and with all due respect to the memory of the lady, the place is a tasteless imitation of European palaces. There was innovation going on at the time of my visit, but to me the visit was really not worth it."
Czar Emmanuel,"The first time I visited this place, its basement was still under construction. Well, even up to now its rooms, where some art collections of the Albano-Adarna family are supposed to be on display, are still under construction and closed to the public. However, there have been some notable changes. There's a restaurant now in the basement and entrance to the temple is no longer free. I also noticed that more people were visiting the place, turning this once private family mausoleum into one of Cebu City's tourist destinations. There's also more traffic, with a long queue of cars waiting to find a slot for a  pay."
richj65,It's clearly Greek inspired but it has a Filipino twist. Perfect combination from the structures  the view and the pleasant environment. Good place to relax.
Brix510,This place was very well made and erected as a dedication of love to leah.  However the upkeep is pretty much non existent and it's sad to see the current state - but even with minimal upkeep its very nice
penasihatperjalanan,"This location is a wedding venue that is partially open as a tourist trap. Most of the interior is closed and tourists are only permitted outside on the large scenic veranda and inside beneath the domed entry area. There's nothing to do here except to pose beside the statues, with a backdrop of structures of architectural interest or a view of the city far below. If you had to choose between views or talking selfies here or the nearby The Tops, there's little difference and there's no reason to visit both."
aaddelgado,"Massive structure but not much to see inside. Not much to do. Still incomplete. View is nice. There were a lot of people visiting. Parking is available. Overall, the entrance fee of Php100 is too pricey."
Kristine R,"Before our Cebu trip in May 2022, I have never heard about the Temple of Leah. We only learned about the place thru the cab driver who took us to our hotel from the Mactan Airport upon our arrival. We arranged a city tour with the driver the next day, and voila! We were on our way to the temple, which was perched high up in the mountainous part of Cebu City. The Temple was named after the late Leah Albino-Adarna, the grandmother of Filipino starlet Ellen Adarna. Because of its location, the temple offers a breathtaking view of Cebu City, and inevitably gives visitors a feeling that they are abroad due to the Greek-inspired architecture. The place is good for taking pictures, and gives a glimpse of the grandmother’s collection of jars, liquor bottles, and other ornaments. The Temple of Leah is one of Cebu City’s must-see attractions that will be enjoyed by tourists of all ages."
TengCorrea,"Dubbed as Cebu's Taj Mahal, this majestic structure is dedicated by a husband to his late wife. Its lies in the details as in its giant pillars, intricately designed staircase and high golden ceiling. Place also houses various items collected from wife's travels. It's not open when I visited but you can peek through the windows to have a look.Located 45 mins from the city center, one can take habal-habal in front of JY Square Mall. I got mine for Php400 which includes visits to Sirao Pictorial Garden and the newly opened Little Kyoto.Entrance fee at Php100. There's a snack and souvenir kiosk right by the plaza area. Without having to buy anything though, you can sit in one of their huts. There's a view of the city from there. My driver said it's not the same but almost close to view at Tops, another tourist attraction in area."
jakebojorque,Definitely a place worth visiting. Situated up the hills of busay. With a breathtaking view of the city.
Sazeena N,"Beautiful place with a great view of the city. It is very touching to know the story behind of this temple. It is beautifully architected at a very good location. Entrance for this place is free and need to be very patient to get a good shot. Well I do recommend people to go there, witness and enjoy exploring more stories of that city."
Francis_Elvis_Verdin,"Built-in 2012, this elaborate Roman-style temple is dedicated to Leah Villa Albino-Adarna. It has a breathtaking overlooking of Cebu."
