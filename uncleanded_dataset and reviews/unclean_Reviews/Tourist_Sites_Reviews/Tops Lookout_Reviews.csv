Rob,Really enjoyed this place.  It was under renovation when we arrived although we were still able to enjoy an excellent meal.  Definately worth the trip.
Jay Santos,Beautiful to visit during at night. Though visiting this place during the day is great too if you want to see the Cordova bridge.It can be crowded in the main viewing area but there are plenty of space for everyone.
SoulBrotherTravels,What a great look out location to take in the whole of Cebu city.We were here as the sun was setting and it was amazing!Take some food and drink with you or enjoy one of the many food outlets in the area.
Vannie B,Ive been to Cebu for so many times but this is my 1st time to visit this place. Its overlooking CEBU because the place place is top of the mountain and it has a very nice view specially in the afternoon when the sunset goes down. plus the restaurant around there where there is a lot of tourist going just to dine and see the place
A Santiago,"Amazing view of the city lights at night. Place is mostly tidy but some visitors are not responsible with their trash. Nevertheless, the air is good and the view is much better when shared with good company"
Irish Mae,"perfect place to chill. It offers 360 degrees view of Cebu City. We went there during night, it was fogging and the city lights of cebu city is amazing to look"
Sazeena N,"A wide view of the city esp. at night. The night view of this place is just amazing. It is also amazing to see people gathering, do bbq along with the sunset and night view. The wind is quite strong there in an enjoyable way. The Entrance fee is 100 PHP per person and the visit is much more worth the amount."
Francis_Elvis_Verdin,A Nice view if you visit the Tops Lookout during the sunset time because you will witness the transformation of daytime to twilight and also the view of street lights.
raycoyd,Tops lookout is really a nice vantage point if you love to see Cebu City and other neighboring Cities like Mandaue and Talisay City. The best time to come here is during sunset to night where you can see the dazzling lights of the cities below. The temperature is cold.
brine,all i see is the wide vision of the city. . it is good to be here at summer time and not in bad weather. . all are visible in good weather and at night so nice
Carlos Salinas,"It is the perfect spot to enjoy your last night in Cebu. Up on the top, they have food and drink stalls and make sure to bring your camera for nice pictures."
conte,"nothing so special here and not so accessible without private vehicle,less options of my demands, , not so interesting in my opinion. . ."
LolaGo1,"We arrived here around 11:00 am on a Tuesday morning. Entrance fee is 50 pesos per person. I was the only visitor at this time. All the small restaurants around the Lookout were all closed.Due to its elevated location, the cities below can be seen from the distance. Took several pictures here before leaving  for my next attractions."
Vez A,"It was almost a snap decision to spend time in Tops Lookout. We were rewarded with a fantastic view of the city, with a refreshing wind blowing constantly. Although the place needs some sprucing up, we recommend that first time visitors to Cebu take some time to visit this place. It won’t disappoint. A coffee shop would do wonders for guests who’d want to stay a little longer."
Robert W,"You must get a gas taxi to go there, not propane. It's a great view, but not much to do after 15 minutes."
Ryan S,"This place reminded me of Twin Peakes in San Francisco or the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. Panoramic views for 100 miles or more. I was disappointed that they charged to enter the park when it appeared to be free according to most places. I went in the day time when it was dead and do not regret it. Apparently it is mobbed at night and there is no parking available then, or at least it is insufficient."
Samcebu,Great views of the city got to go in the evenings better for pictures. There are no activities there hard to get to but worth I.
reddogsailor,Excellent Food and a wonderful place to see the sunset over Cebu. Prices are reasonable also. Highly recommend the stuffed Tuna belly.
Wenifer Dawson,When you enjoy nature at nights with a great view of the city lights being peaceful and quiet then you have to check out this place. Friends and families can hang around while having a good chat. There are also good restaurants within the area.
Peewee Rodney S,"The place and the view are breathtaking except the rusted roof needs urgent replacement! It is embarrassing when capturing with a drone cam, even with our naked eyes standing on the center or edge of the location. The rot reflects negligence so act fast, please!"
