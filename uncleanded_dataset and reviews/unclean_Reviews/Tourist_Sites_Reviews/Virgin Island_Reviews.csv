talen2316,We are a party of 18 that stayed at Anika Island Resort. We booked an Island hopping which included Virgin Island…it was a relaxing and satisfying trip. VI have all the amenities.
Paul C,Always nice to have a seafood picnic and swimming at Virgin Island during mid week on off season when there are few tourists
TengCorrea,Didn't get to spend as much as I want to because I only had about an hour left on my island shopping tour but place is a well developed strip with tables and refreshments. Water is clear. There's a shallow area where there are rocks so kids or non-swimmers like me can snorkel.Entrance fee at 250 pesos for a solo traveler. This is relatively higher compared to the usual in Philippine islands. You need to take a boat to go here. Best if traveling in a group as rates at 1000 pesos per island. Not so sure if they allow joiners at this point given COVID.
Paul C,"Best visit early morning during a weekday to avoid crowds. Island is clean and tidy and the sea crystal clear. Food is surprisingly good. Must try the freshly grilled squid. Prices are ok for a tourist spot.We are a family of 14... 8 adults, 2 teenagers and 4 kids. With covid rules, we normally spend about 2,600 for the boat rental (5 hours on the island), 2,000 entrance fee (Adults 200 Children 100 Seniors from Bantayan free) and about 3,000 for a good beach picnic"
Ron,"Visited here 2nd time.This place is still amazing and always give me peace of mindMy fave place is at the back area of the resort.The place is really a paradise.Entrance is 500 for first 2 guest.I would love to go back and stay overnight in one of their cabin.  Daytour  is not enough for me. I would love to see either sunset or sunrise in this paradise.I will surely go back.Lots to do here esp lots of place to chill and relax. Do cliff diving, picnic, swimming.Paradise....."
lalalageselle,"This is an amazing, beautiful island that I highly recommend you to visit. The trip there is a boat ride for about 20-30 minutes depending on how the waves are. It has tables and chairs, places to get some food from. There are fees so prepare for that. Not expensive though and definitely worth it! Snorkel with the fishies and swim on the beach. It’s a great time for your family!"
Tina K,"We visited the island with private banka early in the morning, so we were almost alone at this precious place, it really looks like paradise with white soft sand and crystal clear water. I recommend to start early to have the piece we enjoyed, before other tourists arrives. Entrance fee is 500 PHP per person.There is also cliff jumping available."
Harry O,A must see. Spectacular beaches. Lots of services but at a high price so bring your own food and drinks. Entrance fee is 500 pesos for 2 people and 100 pesos every extra person.
Donny B,"Nice island to visit when you are staying on Bantayan. Just a 20 minute boat ride away (depending on where you leave from Bantayan) and you are greeted by a pearly white beach. Downside is that everything on the island is rentable. So almost every seat or bench or picnic table you need to pay for. Nothing to complain though, it is very pretty overall with nice snorkeling options."
Mel Brockhouse,A really nice little Island perfect for swimming and relaxing with a few small places to eatNothing especially spectacular to do but the ambience and beauty more than make up for that
